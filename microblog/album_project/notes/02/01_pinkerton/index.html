<h2>notes for february 1</h2>

<h1>Pinkerton by Weezer</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Tired of Sex</h4>

<p>jesus what an introduction, both thematically and instrumentally; it’s so off-putting intentionally- and that post-chorus too :O</p>

<p>damn I was not expecting that chaotic of a guitar solo, this song is so ridiculously toned it actually kinda works ^^</p>

<h4>Getchoo</h4>

<p>somehow that double verse kinda put me off, but the gritty quality of everything here (especially that chorus), it fits more thematically</p>

<p>and jesus christ the instrumentation here seems so much more like organized chaos and disillusion than their debut, I love that quality of this so far</p>

<h4>No Other One</h4>

<p>oh my god the tone of this track really sets it for me- the desperation of both the speaker and his girlfriend is one of those terrifying moments like in Outkast’s Hey Ya: being in a relationship because you fear being alone, not out of love or intimacy</p>

<p>and every quality of this track fits that like a glove ^</p>

<h4>Why Bother?</h4>

<p>yea this is a very human record- being scared of getting started with a relationship because…</p>

<p>well you can hear the lyrics in the song, it’s very straightforward</p>

<p>pretty good tho, as usual</p>

<h4>Across the Sea</h4>

<p>ah so this is one of the two classics- this one about being obsessed with a japanese fan who sent Cuomo a letter, and the other… well</p>

<p>regardless, I think all the things on this record, from the theme of it, album cover, and all the content and experiences it’s based in, just make it seem so vulnerable and the equivalent of a weak moment</p>

<p>which is charming, to be honest :)</p>

<p>yea seriously, from the bridge to the ending is so damn good :D</p>

<h4>The Good Life</h4>

<p>this is the best song on this record, no question</p>

<p>it’s like the peak of everything I’ve described- it’s cattish and potent in its attitude, but just so lovingly relatable</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I ain&#39;t gonna hurt nobody, ain&#39;t gonna cause a scene<br/>Just need to admit that I want sugar in my tea</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and how can you not absolutely love that ending, my god :O</p>

<h4>El Scorcho</h4>

<p>oh nvm, there’s three of those type of songs on this record; I forgot about that first line lmao</p>

<p>wait but how is this track actually stunning, wth :O</p>

<p>everything about this record’s progression edges on the line of absolute toxicity, but the offsetting styles of how innocent sounding Rivers can be at times makes this record in such a category of its own</p>

<h4>Pink Triangle</h4>

<p>yep this is the third track =&lt;&gt;=</p>

<p>and this is another perfect example of what I was talking about- the theme of this track is both charming and absolutely unsettling given the imagery and Rivers’s imagination</p>

<p>but that is exactly what makes it bearable at the start, and endearing by the end (to me at least)</p>

<h4>Falling for You</h4>

<p>that was a fantastic transition tho, my god</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Holy cow, I think I&#39;ve got one here<br/>Now just what am I supposed to do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>hahaha I love it- finally something turned a corner, and he’s just lost</p>

<p>oh… and then the chorus, where he both loves her and absolutely hates the commitment and worry of being accepted at all</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just as I was busting loose<br/>I gotta go turn in my rock star card<br/>And get fat and old with you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>exactly, I love this take from Rivers given how this record is coated in his depression after their debut record…</p>

<p>weezer makes nerd hero music</p>

<h4>Butterfly</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess you&#39;re as real as me<br/>Maybe I can live with that<br/>Maybe I need fantasy<br/>Life of chasing butterfly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>god okay- I absolutely love this record… I’m glad it is the length that it is, I’m glad it straddles that line so well, and this ending is such a fantastic closer to the story</p>

<p>thank u mr rivers</p>
