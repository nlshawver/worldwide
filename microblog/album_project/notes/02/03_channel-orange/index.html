<h2>notes for february 3</h2>

<h1>channel ORANGE by Frank Ocean</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Start</h4>

<p>gotta love the flair of all the nostalgic video game sound bytes :)</p>

<h4>Thinkin Bout You</h4>

<p>alright, five out of five track already; this is an absolute treat</p>

<p>god everything about this song just feels incredible, I absolutely love the very slight, simple instrumental in all these amazing vocal lines :D</p>

<h4>Fertilizer</h4>

<p>okay I didn’t think too sandwich bread interlude/transition pieces would work well, but that added a cool bit of separation in all honesty</p>

<h4>Sierra Leone</h4>

<p>ooh I love the lyrical back and forth, that’s a wonderful sort of feeling :)</p>

<p>and that chorus, with Ocean’s vocals swimming through the instrumental is such a great choice, and the aesthetic is produces is amazing for such a short track</p>

<h4>Sweet Life</h4>

<p>I didn’t initially think that first verse was all that special, but seriously it flows so damn well into that fantastic chorus :O</p>

<p>I think I might be so used to Frank Ocean’s style now it doesn’t feel as special as it should- but I know it’s absolutely lovely, and this track is the little peak of the first third of this record so far :)</p>

<h4>Not Just Money</h4>

<p>especially with the theme of the last track, I love all these interludes, and they fit so well :)</p>

<h4>Super Rich Kids (feat. Earl Sweatshirt)</h4>

<p>okay damn, we’re already on this track :D</p>

<p>that Earl Sweatshirt feature is seriously such a great back and forth, and the offsetting energy and tonality of their voices is amazing- not even mentioning the meaning of the lyrics and how well it fits into this album’s thematic path</p>

<p>I love this track, definitely my favorite so far (even if the record just seems to keep improving over itself)</p>

<h4>Pilot Jones</h4>

<p>oh my god that subtle, threatening bass; it gets <em>so low</em> :O</p>

<p>it’s just kind of a subtle, meaningfully somber track, and it’s just so well done– even if compared to the other tracks it doesn’t stick out as much</p>

<h4>Crack Rock</h4>

<p>the introduction of this track certainly does though; I love the instantly punchy drum set, with the plucky synth under it</p>

<p>and of course Ocean’s vocals :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hittin&#39; stones in glass homes<br/>You&#39;re smokin&#39; stones in abandoned homes<br/>You hit them stones and broke your home</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that’s such a weird, unsettling reprieve… and the rest of the track fits the underlying theme well, as usual ^</p>

<p>jesus, and that last hook is so striking :O</p>

<h4>Pyramids</h4>

<p>those backwards drums- and my GOD those synths, what the hell</p>

<p>AHHHH that first verse is an absolute jam, that’s seriously shocking how well this comes together</p>

<p>the layers of intrigue and meaning behind this track is jaw-dropping; there’s no other way to say it :O</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Got rubies in my damn chain<br/>Whip ain&#39;t got no gas tank but it still got woodgrain<br/>Got your girl working for me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that set of lines alone has like three meanings all at once… it’s indescribable how insane this man is at crafting a lyrical story in such a compelling, multi-faceted way</p>

<h4>Lost</h4>

<p>damn, it seemed like there was no way to transition out of that last track, and while I think this track feels completely different to Pyramids, this does feel like a worthy, well-done follow-up :)</p>

<p>also that chorus is an absolute jam, such a wonderful aesthetic ^</p>

<h4>White (feat. John Mayer)</h4>

<p>damn okay, that super synth-like, buzzing bass line is amazing :D</p>

<p>that’s a great little break, I appreciate that</p>

<h4>Monks</h4>

<p>alright alright, what a punchy, expressive introduction to this track</p>

<p>god, and those floaty synths at the third verse are lovely- and OOH that bass line with Frank’s vocals</p>

<p>it’s really just the same good stuff over and over again, just with these nice little differences in aesthetic and instrumental details</p>

<h4>Bad Religion</h4>

<p>okay the first time I heard this I wasn’t terribly impressed, and it felt like a sort of transitionary track- but knowing the meaning of everything he’s singing, it’s genuinely touching and emotional knowing how it all meshes together</p>

<p>and especially how this instrumental fits together, and the progression it takes on throughout the track; it’s just impressive and lyrically beautiful, that’s all</p>

<h4>Pink Matter (feat. André 3000)</h4>

<p>I like the subtlety of this track, ya know &gt;v&gt;</p>

<p>but seriously, this is absolutely amazing- I can’t keep saying the same things about these tracks</p>

<p>GOD I love the 3k feature; just like Earl his aesthetic clashes in a beautiful, chaotic way, even if their topic of interest is the exact same</p>

<p>this track made me appreciate this record so much more than I did before, and for that I can’t help but make this my favorite track on the album so far :)</p>

<h4>Forrest Gump</h4>

<p>and this just feels like a subtle, touching lead down to the end of the record</p>

<p>the layered vocals are a lovely treat for the ending of this in particular, and everything is lovely</p>

<p>it’s all lovely :)</p>

<h4>End</h4>

<p>oh I love this so damn much; the rain being the focal point is the perfect setting, and dude- when the car opens, my god it just feels like one of those nights where you don’t know what to do exactly as a whole, but you just do what you want right in the moment, without regard for how it looks on the outside</p>

<p>it’s all on the inside; that’s the aesthetic I get, and it’s wonderful</p>

<p>jesus christ that break was such an unusual, transcendent sort of trip</p>

<p>I can’t explain it, but it just feels so right to have a moment like that, it’s magnificent</p>

<p>oh yea, and the instrumental feels like a soulful minecraft rendition with how playful and hopeful it comes off as :)</p>

<p>I don’t know how I feel about the pitched down Tyler vocals, but I love the line it ends on:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I free-fall off the hill again<br/>Let&#39;s see where I land, I&#39;m like Gilligan<br/>Um, I trust you, Golden, for wed ring<br/>I&#39;m just hopin&#39; that you don&#39;t turn my neck green</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and it’s just the beach and this island, and that’s all</p>

<p>BUT THE MF LAUGH TRACK</p>
