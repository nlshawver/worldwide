<h2>notes for february 11</h2>

<h1>Peasant by Richard Dawson</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Herald</h4>

<p>okay this started out really beautiful and in a sort of off-setting, charming way with its dissonance, but now the horns are just talking back and forth and I love it :)</p>

<h4>Ogre</h4>

<p>that was a really great start, but I’m not sure how to feel about these vocals honestly- it feels very worn and pre-modern in nature</p>

<p>which I guess is the exact right aesthetic for a record of this styling and genre; I do like the fact that a lot of these lyrics have a sort of corresponding modern connection, and in a quite creative way ^</p>

<p>holy shit- the underlying meaning of this track with this incredible expressive and bordering on shrill singing feels so powerful and moving; I don’t think it starts fantastically, and I’m not sold as much on the style yet, but jesus that track was honestly pretty incredible :O</p>

<h4>Soldier</h4>

<p>that verse sounded alluringly somber, and while I don’t like the vocal intonation as much on the chorus, the soundscape of this track is quite pleasant and tense simultaneously</p>

<p>I also really love the deep, rumbling bass notes that pop in and out every once in a while, they add to a bit of the creeping aesthetic in a good way :)</p>

<h4>Weaver</h4>

<p>I have similar opinions about this track, but I love a lot more of the guitar work and how crisp the melodies can be; it’s a discordant but engaging set of sounds that really adds a heap of likability to the track :)</p>

<p>oh my god and those singing chants at the end were incredible, that wrapped together the track in a very, very good way :O</p>

<h4>Prostitute</h4>

<p>wow… I thought the vocals on this track were just much more touching, but with these insane warbled and analogue synth pulses, it tied together this whole narrative in a shockingly wretched way</p>

<p>this track was unbelievable, I don’t know what else to say honestly…</p>

<h4>Shapeshifter</h4>

<p>I really like this starting instrumental, that’s a really good jam :D</p>

<p>I think some of the vocal lines especially at the tail end of the chorus can be grating and bordering on uncomfortable to listen to, but my god if the rest of the track isn’t just such a soulful trip ^</p>

<p>dude… and that ending that just drops you off of a cliff :O</p>

<h4>Scientist</h4>

<p>okay okay, all of these instrumentals are so raspy and somehow so comfortable in that attention to detail; it’s hard not to feel connected to some of them, even if the record has weaved in and out of that confidence of comfort</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a fellow citizen of reason<br/>I strongly suggest you reconsider your position<br/>Or you may face the wrath of truly dire consequences</p>
</blockquote>

<p>jesus christ, that’s the best vocal line on this whole record, that’s jaw-dropping with the chants after it, the insanely invigorating instrumental, and just the path to this track on the LP</p>

<p>bruh that ending 0_0</p>

<h4>Hob</h4>

<p>I guess that ending sort of accurately pitches us into the sound of this track and its start though- even though we get an incredible horn and string instrumental right after its grating aesthetic</p>

<p>I think this track does develop well into a bit of a disconcerting and chaotic, but somehow delicate sort of instrumental styling- which just sounds good to my ears ^</p>

<p>and oh my lord if that ending set of verses that develop this story to a bit of end aren’t just wrenching to your ears; it straddles the line of being grossly overdone and charmingly self-evident, and I don’t entirely know how</p>

<h4>Beggar</h4>

<p>I thought the guitar on this track was good, but jesus christ those harsh drum stings were shocking :O</p>

<p>the vocals here are strained in a way that comes off very genuinely, so I thought that deserved a little compliment in terms of the cohesion of the track (and LP in general)</p>

<p>I do also really like the way these verses have a similar styling to each, and that fourth and final verse was touching- it closed out the vocals so well :)</p>

<p>shoutout to that snow-colored dog tho ^</p>

<h4>No-one</h4>

<p>that was a chilling little instrumental interlude, and a great entrance into the final track</p>

<h4>Masseuse</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Fortune wags its tongue</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know what it is about it, but that’s a great vocal opener, on top of this interesting instrumentation (as always, of course)— and oh my god the chaos after the second verse is so driving and forceful :O</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, now you see<br/>The Pin&#39;s a pebble only<br/>That which you so thirstily<br/>Coveted over my dead body</p>
</blockquote>

<p>wow… that’s a surprisingly powerful piece of a great ending, and it gets even more intense right after… it’s such a shocking, both melancholic and deeply punchy ending to this LP</p>

<p>I think this deserves a re-listen at some point to better understand the overarching story, but I do really like it for what it is at the present moment, as it all fades to black after the profound vocality stretches through these pulsating, sweeping drums and strings…</p>
