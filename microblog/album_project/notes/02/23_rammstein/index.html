<h2>notes for february 23</h2>

<h1>untitled by Rammstein</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Deutschland</h4>

<p>jesus christ what an introduction- I’ve already heard this track many many times before, and I love it more and more each time… but to start an album? MY GOD :D</p>

<p>that second verse, with the german wordplay gets me the most in this whole thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Überheblich, überlegen<br/>Übernehmen, übergeben<br/>Überraschen, überfallen<br/>Deutschland, Deutschland über allen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the mix of synths, destructive drum beat, and Lindemann’s vocals just makes for an stunningly succinct and potent cut :O</p>

<p>I just dread that this track is like what I was fearing on RATM’s debut; this carries the whole LP, and the rest just rides the coattails of it</p>

<h4>Radio</h4>

<p>while this track doesn’t start the best to my ears, the actual verses and chorus are not bad at all ^^</p>

<p>and (through an english translation) these lyrics are great too- a very similar message to that of some cuts on yesterday’s LP, but from a unique perspective no doubt :O</p>

<p>I think this is a very fitting continuation from the last track, even if it’s much different in theme and style (outside of the very obvious metal theme, I know)</p>

<h4>Zeig dich</h4>

<p>those chanting vocals feel perfectly ethereal for the start of this cut :O</p>

<p>this is another track where the theme and overall message are greatly compelling and interesting- I just think unfortunately, even though the instrumental is still incredibly forceful, the intricate styling is becoming a tiny bit of a hindrance</p>

<p>that guitar work is insanely good though, I have to say :O</p>

<h4>Ausländer</h4>

<p>somehow this track is actually really compelling; the verses are so sinister in their delivery, and the choruses having six different languages is a simple but effective thematic choice :)</p>

<p>just a great part of this LP’s arc; very nice ^^</p>

<h4>Sex</h4>

<p>wow be more subtle please; it took this band long enough to make a track called Sex, given the fact one of their more popular songs is just called Pussy</p>

<p>this track is endearingly off-putting and insane at times, but a lot of the time it just comes off as pretty dumb</p>

<p>it somehow does not make the chorus less of an earworm tho lol (:</p>

<h4>Puppe</h4>

<p>the set-up and meaning of this track is honestly really compelling- the very strained and clearly meaningful lyrics are beautifully suspenseful and touching ^^</p>

<p>holy shit… that chorus is unspeakably forceful and potent; genuinely got goosebumps with each exclamation of Lindemann’s voice :OO</p>

<p>this is likely the best song here since Deutschland, but it just feels so weird to have Sex right before it :/</p>

<p>that was a terrible way to say that…</p>

<h4>Was ich liebe</h4>

<p>honestly quite the nice carry-on from the last track; the vocals in the verses have a very similar quality to them from it, but the chorus is a much more intentionally flowing, and I think that compliments this record’s arc really well :)</p>

<p>I have to compliment the guitar &amp; bass work on this track of course, but seriously it’s been really good throughout the whole record ^</p>

<p>this is one of the better tracks on the record for sure, this is a nice return to form after Sex</p>

<p>I’m not gonna stop with that lmao</p>

<h4>Diamant</h4>

<p>huh, was not expecting this change-up, but I like it :)</p>

<p>wow the vocals here kinda caught me off guard with how beautiful they feel; this is a great leg in the arc of this record :D</p>

<h4>Weit weg</h4>

<p>I was a bit touchy with the start of this track, but damn… after that first chorus and into those soaring synth lines- I love that aesthetic choice :)</p>

<p>I don’t think this is nearly as transcendentally compelling or interesting as Deutschland or Puppe, but my god if it doesn’t feel wonderful to be in the midst of :O</p>

<p>jesus what an ending :D</p>

<h4>Tattoo</h4>

<p>ehhh I’m really not feeling this as much; this has all the elements that make the other tracks on this record have such an influence, but it’s just not as packaged well imo :(</p>

<p>it’s certainly not bad, just a bit forgettable unfortunately—especially unfortunate for the second last track on an LP that has had a really nice progression ^</p>

<h4>Hallomann</h4>

<p>I think the sort of proclamations that are being made here are actually kind of touching, and certainly add to the quality of the track… but the rest just feels so basic and sorta disappointing :(</p>

<p>the vocals here are definitely the best part here, no doubt- and I guess for the ending of an LP, you want a cohesive ending message</p>

<p>and those ending harmonies are pretty great; it’s just a shame it didn’t connect with me nearly as much as I feel it could’ve ^^</p>
