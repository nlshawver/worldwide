<h2>notes for february 7</h2>

<h1>Antics by Interpol</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Next Exit</h4>

<p>huh, I kinda like that introduction- but I fear the same things I didn&#39;t mesh with as much on their first record are just showing up again</p>

<p>but all said and done, that&#39;s a pretty good start to an old indie rock record</p>

<h4>Evil</h4>

<p>ooh, I like that instrumental a lot, but I do not like a lot of the intonation of Banks and his voice over top this instrumentation- it just sounds unpleasantly nasal at times, and I can&#39;t overlook that :c</p>

<p>which is genuinely a shame cause the drums on this are really nice</p>

<h4>Narc</h4>

<p>alright alright, I like this track a lot more, and all the instrumental work compliments Banks&#39;s vocality much better in my opinion</p>

<p>that bass line and cymbal work are the most satisfying to me ^</p>

<p>and oooh that subtle synth harmony underneath all of this–which comes out when the drums are absent–is really nice :)</p>

<h4>Take You on a Cruise</h4>

<p>okay this track is surprisingly good, I love the overall aesthetic with the galloping tone to the guitars, and the drums serve their job perfectly :O</p>

<p>AND WOAH that little mid-track stutter–while a bit expected–gave this track a lovely energy at the midpoint that made its longer track length feel required and worthwhile</p>

<p>this is definitely my favorite track so far (and I really need to listen to their debut LP again)</p>

<h4>Slow Hands</h4>

<p>ooh yea, and that was a very good continuation of the last track; it didn&#39;t seem nearly as unique but I love the general aesthetic of the last two tracks</p>

<h4>Not Even Jail</h4>

<p>damn- this bass intro :O</p>

<p>and for sure, these last three tracks have been much more of an upturn from my thoughts on the first two- and in general from Interpol</p>

<h4>Public Pervert / C’mere</h4>

<p>I don’t have a whole lot to say about these two tracks, but the fact that I have so little to say is both a good and bad thing</p>

<p>I think each of them was charming, and interesting to an extent, but are just spoiled by what’s bracketing the record; I will say that a lot of the bass and drum lines are lovely to listen to, and the subtle detailing is important to how much I think these tracks are an improvement over the other tracks here</p>

<p>overall two pretty good tracks in the middle; this record deserves a closer listen than I gave it today, but I can’t shake the feeling initiated by the overall aesthetic presented</p>

<h4>Length of Love</h4>

<p>okay this is absolutely lovely- definitely my favorite overall track on the album, even if some of the others earlier on had more interesting individual details</p>

<p>this, as a sum of its parts, with the careful intonation and attention to everything that makes it up, is charming—even if the details are a bit fuzzy</p>

<h4>A Time to Be So Small</h4>

<p>this record really should have ended on length of love, or at the very least had a different aesthetic for this track</p>

<p>I don’t know what all it is about it, and maybe it’s a fleeting feeling reserved for this night when I’m reviewing it, but I seriously didn’t like the ending, and I think it spoiled a bit the increase in value and quality of the record up the ninth track :c</p>
