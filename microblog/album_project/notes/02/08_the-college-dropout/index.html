<h2>notes for february 8</h2>

<h1>The College Dropout by Kanye West</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Intro</h4>

<p>what the hell lol</p>

<h4>We Don’t Care</h4>

<p>anyways- jesus this instrumental is so damn powerful and punchy</p>

<p>I don’t know ye sounds so unique and modern on a record almost twenty years old, but this is a great intro track already :O</p>

<p>I feel like a bit of the luster is nostalgic for a time I never fully experienced, but regardless- that was really damn good :)</p>

<h4>Graduation Day</h4>

<p>bruh I cannot take this voice seriously</p>

<p>okay okay, John Legend is a good touch and ending to this short little interlude- that’s nice ^</p>

<h4>All Falls Down (feat. Syleena Johnson)</h4>

<p>another nice, unique instrumental with the acoustic guitar and more thoroughly mixed bass- I love the simplicity ^</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to act ballerific like it&#39;s all terrific<br/>I got a couple past-due bills, I won&#39;t get specific<br/>I got a problem with spendin&#39; before I get it<br/>We all self-conscious, I&#39;m just the first to admit it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>damn what a great ending to that third verse; I love the conscious side of this track and Syleena’s vocals throughout the whole track :)</p>

<h4>I’ll Fly Away</h4>

<p>I think this start to the record feels a bit back and forth, but I do kinda like the inclusion of these small interludes in-between the primary tracks</p>

<p>it’s a nice energy, and it meshes really well all things considered</p>

<h4>Spaceship (feat. GLC &amp; Consequence)</h4>

<p>holy- that deep bass is head-shaking :D</p>

<p>I love the external, transcendent feel of this track thorough its backing vocals and instrumental</p>

<p>and I liked ye’s part, but it feels so good to hear GLC on this track for the second verse ^</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the mall &#39;til 12 when my schedule had said 9<br/>Putting them pants on shelves<br/>Waiting patiently; I ask myself</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and after the rhyme scheme before, this section feels incredible in line with the beat; same sort of feeling with the Consequence verse, it’s a nice change of pace, and both verses match the aesthetic of this track :)</p>

<h4>Jesus Walks</h4>

<p>alright alright, this is the first track I know separately of the LP; I do like a good amount of this, but I think sometimes the sample and instrumental can feel overbearing and claustrophobic</p>

<p>but in general–especially with the verses in between–it’s an interesting and overall good track ^</p>

<p>okay it is very catchy, it’s really good :)</p>

<h4>Never Let Me Down (feat. Jay-Z &amp; J. Ivy)</h4>

<p>honestly I felt like Jay’s verse is a bit underwhelming and under-developed- but seriously Kanye’s part on this is amazing :O</p>

<p>I think especially after the themes of the last track and the slightly mellowed intonation present here, it’s a really great follow-up and </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not a miracle, I&#39;m a heaven-sent instrument<br/>My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes<br/>For your soul and your mental</p>
</blockquote>

<p>oh my god J. Ivy is fantastic on this too; that set of bars and the ending are lovely to hear, and matches up with this track in such a touching, intriguing way</p>

<p>okay Jay’s part at the end is pretty good, and lyrically more skilled imo, I don’t know why he feels so tinny over top of the track though- but seriously: great overall track, and the second best part of this half of the LP</p>

<h4>Get Em High (feat. Talib Kweli &amp; Common)</h4>

<p>oh my god- nevermind about saying the second best, Never Let Me Down is third best now</p>

<p>it’s so braggadocious and slick that you can’t help but be amazed by it; the instrumental adds a great layering to these multi-line rhymes from both Talib &amp; Common—which are an incredible duo to have as features on this track</p>

<p>just a fantastic track to mark the middle of the record, I love it :)</p>

<h4>Workout Plan</h4>

<p>$3.99? damn…</p>

<h4>The New Workout Plan</h4>

<p>HOLY SHI- dude this beat is so crushing, it goes so HARD</p>

<p>ye’s flow over top of all this is so infectious and just so completely expected from Kanye lol</p>

<p>this whole track is so stunning, I don’t even get how this was made- this isn’t my favorite song in how well I think it does artistically, but damn if it isn’t the catchiest :D</p>

<p>and the second part after the interlude is really good with that talk-box and how the theme continues through— and I hear the sample &gt;&lt;</p>

<h4>Slow Jamz (feat. Twista &amp; Jamie Foxx)</h4>

<p>why does she have to drink water if she’s thirsty?</p>

<p>oooh this is funky; I love the introduction and the mellowed energy overall :)</p>

<p>BRUH the Michael Jackson line wth</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the Chi and I be sippin&#39; Hennessy, play some R&amp;B<br/>While I smoke a b, you can preferably find that I&#39;m a G</p>
</blockquote>

<p>jesus christ, what a start for Twista; that was genuinely a jaw-dropping set of bars :O</p>

<p>AND IT KEEPS GOING— I love this track, and it’s such a good start for the second half of this record, especially with how it fits into the progression of the record; the chorus is so damn well-made, the chilled break especially after the Twista verse is lovely ^</p>

<p>thank u mr foxx :)</p>

<h4>Breathe In Breathe Out (feat. Ludacris)</h4>

<p>okay I don’t know how I feel about this start from Luda, but I’ll let it ride</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Always said if I rapped, I&#39;d say somethin&#39; significant<br/>But now, I&#39;m rapping &#39;bout money, hoes, and rims again</p>
</blockquote>

<p>god… that swagger on that line is so damn good :O</p>

<p>okay the Luda feature fits a bit better now, that’s pretty good in terms of the rest of this cut honestly ^</p>

<p>ye with the PHD— the amount of ridiculous, playfully crude bars on this record is somehow charming, even if you end up laughing for a quarter of the track</p>

<p>and that big break where it’s just ye acapella is a great touch, I like that a lot; great track :)</p>

<h4>School Spirit (skit 1)</h4>

<p>no more borrowing from mom for da crack</p>

<p>but that degree keeps him satisfied; and he’s <em>very fast</em> ;)</p>

<h4>School Spirit</h4>

<p>ooh the cadence of ye’s intro &amp; verse here is so good, really puts the whole track in a good place with the lovely little sample and drum beat behind him :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Crack my head on the steering wheel and I ain&#39;t even dead<br/>If I could go through all that and still be breathing<br/>Bitch, bend over, I&#39;m here for a reason</p>
</blockquote>

<p>see exactly- that’s what I was talking about lmao</p>

<p>okay overall this was another great track, especially given its very fitting theme ^</p>

<h4>School Spirit (skit 2)</h4>

<p>those degrees keepin him warm :)</p>

<h4>Lil Jimmy (skit)</h4>

<p>okay I do really like the continued instrumentals over these skits— and I love the fact that these skits have such a hilarious yet introspective theme lol</p>

<h4>Two Words (feat. Mos Def, Freeway &amp; The Boys Choir of Harlem)</h4>

<p>damn you cannot go wrong with Mos Def- that first verse is absolutely stunning :O</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two words: United States, no love, no breaks<br/>Low brow, high stakes, crack smoke, Black folks<br/>Big Macs, fat folks, ecstasy capsules<br/>Presidential scandals, everybody move</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love the repeating theme, it fits his style so well; I love this :D</p>

<p>ye and freeway’s verses after match that energy well too, it meshes here with this incredibly uplifting, cinematic instrumental that I absolutely adore ^</p>

<h4>Through the Wire</h4>

<p>and then we’re RIGHT INTO THIS BANGER</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Story on MTV and I ain&#39;t tryna make a band<br/>I swear, this right here, history in the makin&#39;, man</p>
</blockquote>

<p>he was right :)</p>

<p>god this track is such a recognizable, amiable classic; every single line is creatively vicious, and the personality shown off is so intimate and articulate</p>

<p>I can’t say anything more to describe this insane cut, just go listen to it again :D</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Y&#39;know what I&#39;m sayin&#39;?<br/>When the doctor told me I had, um<br/>That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin<br/>I said, &quot;Dawg, don&#39;t you realize I&#39;ll never make it on a plane now?&quot;<br/>&quot;It&#39;s bad enough I got all this jewelry on!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Family Business</h4>

<p>ooh okay, especially with the sample and beat behind ye’s vocals, this aesthetic after Through the Wire is a fitting, lovely continuation</p>

<p>and damn that sung chorus is absolutely lovely :)</p>

<p>ye’s lines are so likably playful on this track too- these last three tracks have been such a great mini-set in this record ^</p>

<h4>Last Call</h4>

<p>okay all of these beats are lovely, this is such a great start to this incredibly long track ^</p>

<p>haha I love the start of his second verse:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir<br/>Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir<br/>Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest<br/>But all they got left is this guy called West</p>
</blockquote>

<p>oh my god his whole second verse might be the most likeable, catchy, lyrical set of bars on this whole record- I love so much of it :D</p>

<p>and the way this track continues on as a monologue about not wanting introspective Jay-Z, and comments about his recording company is honestly rly charming :)</p>

<p>kanye likes ikea :O</p>

<p>this just feels like an introspective, personal conversation with ye and it&#39;s such a great aesthetic choice– the fact he drops the miracle whip bar and talks about it might be the best part of this lol</p>

<p>don&#39;t take his chorus, he&#39;ll still use it :c</p>

<p>god what an incredible ending tho, especially with that last line- and the sax ends it all, just like it should</p>
