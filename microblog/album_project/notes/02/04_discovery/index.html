<h2>notes for february 4</h2>

<h1>Discovery by Daft Punk</h1>

<hr />

<h4>One More Time (feat. Romanthony)</h4>

<p>yep this song is a masterpiece, you already know exactly what this is</p>

<p>there’s nothing that can be put into words that fully, accurately describes the type of feeling I get from this song; plainly, it’s nostalgia for a time I never lived through, and it feels absolutely amazing :D</p>

<p>everything just works perfectly together as a cohesive piece- and somehow this over 90-second long interlude is a great moment for the song</p>

<p>it never feels drawn out, overplayed, or anything close to obnoxious; it’s too good for that, and I can’t help but feel transcendently happy when I listen to this song</p>

<h4>Aerodynamic</h4>

<p>OHHH MY GOD I hadn’t heard this before (since I’m basic and only know the two main songs off this record) but jesus that is such a funky, incredible introduction</p>

<p>jesus christ, what the hell</p>

<p>I was a little taken aback by the guitar, but when everything came together with that incredible bass line… my god I’m in love with this record right from the start</p>

<p>I got shivers with that soft but somehow punchy synth lead into the outro; this track is wonderful :)</p>

<h4>Digital Love</h4>

<p>hmm, wasn’t expecting that vocal line- but especially with that combination of plucky, slightly soothing synth instrumental, it fits pretty well ^</p>

<p>oooh, and when the drums come in, they’re not too strong or overbearing for their own good, and they mesh with the aesthetic so well :)</p>

<p>damn and the little breaks right back into it are such a lovely vibe :D</p>

<p>EVERYTHING about this record so far is consistently surprising, interesting, and astonishingly charming; I do not understand how this was ever made</p>

<p>thank u mr french men</p>

<h4>Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger</h4>

<p>yup, and you know what this is too; there’s not much to say about this track either</p>

<p>every single part of this song is instantly infectious, and the quick and succinct introduction and shifting of what instruments and details are at the forefront of the sound is what makes this track so endearing :)</p>

<h4>Crescendolls</h4>

<p>huh, interesting choice with that soun- nevermind, <em>what is that SOUND</em></p>

<p>DUDE I can’t keep doing this; that is insane, and I love it all</p>

<p>the constantly increasing melody with that cadence of the drums and backing instrumental makes this go SO HARD</p>

<p>I don’t care how stupid that sounds, listen to this track and you know what I mean- <em>especially</em> with how those record scratches feel like a break right into such a satisfying pay-off</p>

<p>nothing’s frustrating or nearly as annoyingly repetitive as their last LP, everything’s just so fresh</p>

<h4>Nightvision</h4>

<p>I like this, it’s a nice little caprice from the playful and stunning energy of the last five tracks :)</p>

<h4>Superheroes</h4>

<p>okay I thought this would be a slight weak point, but I think the fact the bass line keeps moving around in the background makes the sum of all the parts much better than I expected</p>

<p>I think this honestly might just be the track that most closely resembles their style on Homework, but just more refined and confident in the theme they’re getting across ^</p>

<p>it’s a great club banger, is pretty much what I’m saying</p>

<h4>High Life</h4>

<p>ooh alright, I kinda like the stuttering sample so far</p>

<p>that’s their classic drum beat, bass line, and simple flairs- it just has a bit more of a retro aesthetic because of those crunchy little snares and the feel of those rising chords ^</p>

<p>two great club songs back to back- well all of them are good club songs, but you know what I mean</p>

<h4>Something About Us</h4>

<p>oooh that’s a funky, kinda disorienting sample, but with the more mellow style of this track, it just feels so special :O</p>

<p>it just feels like another worthwhile, useful break in the style of most of the other tracks; a nice little reprieve to talk to your friends and drink instead of just dancing :)</p>

<h4>Voyager</h4>

<p>but it’s only for a bit, cause DAMN this bass line is good- just the right amount of funkiness in a relatively minimal instrumental</p>

<p>no problem with that though; what is there works together as good as everything else on this record :)</p>

<p>oooh love the little music box, that’s amazing :D</p>

<h4>Veridis Quo</h4>

<p>I kinda like how this one starts off pretty slow and just builds up into the full soundscape, it’s such a great feeling hearing it continue to improve and become more complete :)</p>

<p>god this one just feels so introspective, and feels like a time to breathe and think about all that’s around you; the whole track comes together in such a pleasant way with what can only be described as these synth horns/strings offering up a bounty of emotions</p>

<p>it sounds dumb, but that sort of feeling is all I can think of</p>

<h4>Short Circuit</h4>

<p>woah okay, and we’re right back here :O</p>

<p>DUDE I was initially put off by how squishy this song sounded, but jesus that bass line is INSANE</p>

<p>I just didn’t think this track was super special at first, but with how it transitions into this dark, insanely LFO’d soundscape- I don’t know what to say, it just works for me :)</p>

<h4>Face to Face (feat. Todd Edwards)</h4>

<p>alright this track is already a treat with that small sample and how funky the cadence of the instrumental is :D</p>

<p>okay okay, Edwards on this track, and these being the only primary vocals in a very long time on this LP… it feels so lovely hearing him on this one, and it fits thematically so well with the timeline of events at a club</p>

<p>what I’m trying to say is that this track coming on after all the instrumentals would feel <em>incredible</em></p>

<h4>Too Long (feat. Romanthony)</h4>

<p>I have pretty much the same opinion about the onset of this track; the vocals may be barren and alone for most of the start, but as those pianos fade in, and that beat comes in… while the instrumental feels imperfect at the time, it’s a good place to be at the end of a record like this</p>

<p>and the actual lyrics fit with the placement and aesthetic of this song as a whole, so while it’s not as thematically special as the past majority of this record, it is an important part of this progression :)</p>

<p>not saying this is bad at all, it develops very, very slowly- but once everything comes together, and the little breaks cause even more build-up</p>

<p>this thing shines, and the experience carried through on this LP wraps up impeccably</p>
