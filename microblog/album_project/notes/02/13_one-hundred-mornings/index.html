<h2>notes for february 13</h2>

<h1>One Hundred Mornings by Windows96</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Caligula</h4>

<p>what an absolutely stellar introduction to the record; I wrongly labeled Windows96’s last LP I reviewed as synthwave, even though this is very clearly a development of the vaporwave microgenre</p>

<p>and this record is legitimately starting off like the second best example of how good it can be—second only to the original record that got the genre going in the first place</p>

<p>(it’s floral shoppe)</p>

<p>seriously though, the soundscape that this one cut throws you into is just so lovely; the bells, synth stings, and perfectly forceful bass-lines… it’s just so damn well done, I can’t wait for how the rest of this LP develops</p>

<p>like oh my ~god~ that beat switch-up with the twisted, warbled synth melody :O</p>

<p>this is a perfection of a genre; it’s the equivalent of One More Time being the opener to Discovery, it’s that mf amazing :D</p>

<h4>Visage</h4>

<p>ooh I like the synth keys going into this, and the beat is a good continuation of the overall aesthetic path of this LP; the way the beat kinda stutters in a unique way every once in a while is also a really nice touch imo :)</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>damn… that direct chop right into the beat was really nice; throws you right into the intentionally dissonant and minutely tuned synth harmonies :)</p>

<p>god that ending bass-line was really nice too; the only complaint/misstep for this LP so far for me is how short it is…</p>

<h4>Visions I</h4>

<p>I think that flute is a really nice touch, and it’s a nice and small stylistic change-up that fits the track really well</p>

<p>and yet again the bass is so loveably crisp and perfectly placed to mesh well with the rest of the soundscape; I adore this :)</p>

<h4>Visions II</h4>

<p>ooh that’s a really nice transition; I like the rewinding sort of styling to it ^</p>

<p>oh my god that bass :O</p>

<p>it&#39;s a recurring theme for me to like it, but seriously, it&#39;s so damn good; it continually matches the theme and tone of each track so well, it adds a lot to the overall experience imo :)</p>

<h4>Bliss</h4>

<p>okay okay, that little melody to start off this last cut of the midsection is really well-made ^</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad this track is a little longer, it gives it so much more room to grow and change its own tone and aesthetic throughout the runtime :)</p>

<p>like I love that little playful synth melody that just pops up in the middle of the track; it&#39;s so mf good :D</p>

<h4>Languages</h4>

<p>it is the beginning of the end; and jesus if the end isn&#39;t coated in silk, and thudding with crunchy yet supple bass :O</p>

<p>that&#39;s such an interesting, gorgeously off-kilter beat standing out in front of these confused synth harmonies; this is the second best track for me, it&#39;s so well-done in its purpose ^</p>

<h4>Rituals</h4>

<p>oh my GOD that start is so damn good :O</p>

<p>it&#39;s just filled with a swagger and confidence that the whole LP hasn&#39;t had since its onset, my god... I was scared this thing was going to be scarily front-loaded, but no, this is a barbell :)</p>

<p>AND THE BASS</p>

<p>yea this LP is really mf good; I know it&#39;s not transcendentally attuned like a few other of my top albums up to this point, but this just feels like perfection</p>

<h4>Mind Mirage</h4>

<p>thank god these last three tracks have the runtime to grow; this LP&#39;s only fault is that it doesn&#39;t last too long (but it&#39;s also perfectly bite-sized, which might be it&#39;s greatest strength in not staying past its welcome)</p>

<p>this track has another really appealing and charmingly spirited melody, all going into a really interesting set of warped synth keys ^</p>

<p>interesting instrumental change into these pulsating bass and harmonic leads, I like this progression... but that&#39;s all it has at its end</p>
