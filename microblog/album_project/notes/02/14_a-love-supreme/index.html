<h2>notes for february 14</h2>

<h1>A Love Supreme by John Coltrane</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Pt. I – Acknowledgement</h4>

<p>I’m not sure how I’ll go about reviewing this much compared to the other records I’ve listened to, since I’m not nearly as well-versed in the art of jazz than other genres or music as a whole</p>

<p>but oh my god, if the start of this track doesn’t feel incredibly refined, specifically natured, and wonderfully wide and diverse in its styling and soundscape :O</p>

<p>the saxophone is a certified staple and perfectly intoned, but that drum and bass behind this all is beautiful too :)</p>

<p>I feel like I heard the lick in there somewhere, but I will bar my uneducated ears from taking over my brain ^</p>

<p>god, I don’t know what it’s properly called, but the strained, buzzing sax right before the four minute mark is amazing; and the little mini-melodies and wonderful long tones that come afterwards are such a great touch :D</p>

<p>woah, and there’s a moment at around the 5:30 mark where everything sort of shifts towards the center of my headphones… and I guess it’s fitting that right after everything feels more connected, that the record title is sauntered in by these layered vocals—even if it’s more-so a proclamation</p>

<p>what a wonderful start, I adore jazz music exactly for experiences like this</p>

<h4>Pt. II – Resolution</h4>

<p>I will always be a fan of upright bass, it has such an interesting, dark, and intriguing complexion to its sound; and the way the piano, sax, and drums explode in after the bass starts it off genuinely shook me a bit :O</p>

<p>you feel so refined and in a mysterious yet perfectly home-centered environment when listening to something like this… I guess it helps that the lead mastermind behind this record is insanely gifted; I would have to assume that helps just a bit ^</p>

<p>and the piano solo (or break, whichever fits better) is a great shift away from the saxophone center this record started off on</p>

<p>not saying I’m not excited for when the sax comes back in though, because of course I’m not :)</p>

<p>and it feels like it slowly walked down and up the stairs about 4 3/4 minutes in, I liked that little sub-section (and the little squeals from it that come not too far after); that’s a great ending as well, as it ever-so-slightly trails out</p>

<h4>Pt. III – Pursuance</h4>

<p>I do love how all the tracks so far have started with the focal point being one specific instrument in the band: first the sax, then the bass, now the drums—with an incredible little solo if I must say, it’s a nice balance of absolute confusion and chaos, mixed in with incredible attention to detail and skeletal use of rhythm cohesion to keep it all together</p>

<p>it’s nice too when everything comes together after a little more than a minute of being solely the drum-set… but I love that Coltrane and his sax only stays for a bit, and then sounds as if he turns around and walks out the room to grab a whiskey sour or manhattan, just to let the slightly quiet but incredibly detailed sound of the piano shine for a while :)</p>

<p>then he comes back and slams out an incredible solo over the bombastic drum-set, with both of them just going insane :O</p>

<p>ahh, I love the indulgence in that basic but satisfying little micro-melody at around the seven minute mark, especially as a way to close out Coltrane’s incredibly long solo, and give way to the drums to have an explosive finish and leave the bass to fiddle around and provide a nice little respite :)</p>

<p>I didn’t think the bass would get the whole rest of the track to itself, but it has plenty of worthwhile staying power- I love the contrast from the rest of the track, and it just feels so supple and lovely hearing another great musician play around in such an artistic manner</p>

<h4>Pt. IV – Psalm</h4>

<p>this introduction the first time the timpani’s here just feels like you’re in a foggy european city, it’s so damn well-fit and perfect in its styling ^</p>

<p>I do love the fact that the Coltrane’s sax gets most of the attention as a walk-off for the rest of this record, but I think the fact that the timpani is here, along with the stuttering piano that weaves itself in between the saxophone is what really makes this track</p>

<p>I will say though that the saxophone is the core aspect here though, and it has such an incredible ere of flourishing allure to it all throughout the track</p>

<p>and the way the whole soundscape rises gently into a miniature explosion to cap off the end is so lovely; what an experience… :O</p>
