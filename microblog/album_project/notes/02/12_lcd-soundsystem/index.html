<h2>notes for february 12</h2>

<h1>self-titled by LCD Soundsystem</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Daft Punk Is Playing at My House</h4>

<p>huh alright, was only sort of expecting a style like this; it’s much more skeletal than I was expecting in all honesty</p>

<p>I do really like this persistent guitar riff though, and the cowbell is a lovely touch lol (:</p>

<p>honesty that’s a pretty good opener, I can kind of understand the appeal going into the fact that this is their first LP</p>

<h4>Too Much Love</h4>

<p>huh alright- I really like the bass-line and primary instrumental, but the vocals are actually much less interesting that I they came off as the first time around</p>

<p>it feels like Daft Punk’s homework, in that there’s a dedication to one sort of sound for a long period of time before changing anything up—which can be either surprisingly well-made, or just a repetitive slog… and I’m really leaning towards the latter for this track :c</p>

<p>I do think it gets much more appealing and interesting after the second half though, with the chaotic drum line behind the stuttering synth lead ^</p>

<h4>Tribulations</h4>

<p>okay okay, I do really like the driving synth change-up opening this track though, it’s the perfect level of overblown and minimal at the same time</p>

<p>I think the vocals are alright, and they get better with time as you get more and more into the meat of the song ^</p>

<p>ooh and I really like the fadeout of the guitar that leaves the bare instrumental behind it, that was a nice little moment; and the ending is even better, I think this is a much better continuation from the opening track, and lends to this style much better :)</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>oh shit, I love this energy :O</p>

<p>the vocals are surprisingly interesting, and I absolutely love the incredible drum and guitar line that explodes into the track :D</p>

<p>somehow this is my favorite track so far, I just adore the little switch-up it provided :)</p>

<p>gotta love the slow-down at the end too ^</p>

<h4>Never as Tired as When I’m Waking Up</h4>

<p>hmm, another interesting switch-up in styling; these vocals are much more compelling and deeply calming than the rest of the LP has given me</p>

<p>okay this is already so good, this is a great follow-up, and might be another high point on the record for me given the progression up to this point ^</p>

<p>god I love the relatively simplistic guitar work around three minutes in, it matches and adds so much to the aesthetic of this track, it’s absolutely lovely :)</p>

<p>new favorite, and this midsection of the record is much better to my ears</p>

<h4>On Repeat</h4>

<p>I thought I’d be turned off by the long duration of this track, but this is honestly a bit of a sleeper; it has a great mix of general energy along with how the instrumental works with Murphy’s vocals, and I think it compliments the stylistic choices of the last two tracks really well :)</p>

<p>it obviously does get a bit repetitive, but the styling of the track keeps it from being monotonous in my opinion- and it’s a good track leading into the final third of the (standard) album runtime</p>

<h4>Thrills</h4>

<p>ooh, that’s a weird, crushing instrumental going into this, and I don’t know how I feel about it in all honesty</p>

<p>I do like the mixing of the vocals that come in, especially by the 1:15 mark- and I like the slight instrumental change right after (and then through to the end) :O</p>

<p>I think this one just gets better with time, even if the main instrumental choice is so harsh to my ears; the start was just a shock</p>

<h4>Disco Infiltrator</h4>

<p>wow okay, I already love this :D</p>

<p>the slick instrumental is a great touch, and the vocals overall on this record have gotten better and better throughout the tracklist imo :)</p>

<p>that was just an overall great track, I love the ending a lot too ^^</p>

<h4>Great Release</h4>

<p>huh, I like the slightly mellow, yet positive intonation of this final track- and when the vocals finally come in it feels like a really great moment :)</p>

<p>can’t not love the huge strings that appear behind this whole soundscape too ^</p>

<p>honestly somehow a bit underwhelming, and it certainly didn’t seem as transcendent of a release as I was expected– but it still closes off the primary record in a great place, and I came to appreciate this album much more than I expected :)</p>

<p>and I guess he left the room :O</p>
