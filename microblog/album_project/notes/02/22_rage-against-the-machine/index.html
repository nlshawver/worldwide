<h2>notes for february 22</h2>

<h1>self-titled by Rage Against The Machine</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Bombtrack</h4>

<p>great little bass line and DAMN what an introduction to a band :D</p>

<p>that descending tri-tone in the chorus is such a fantastic groove; I can&#39;t get the smile off my face :)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what it is about this track, just jesus christ I love it- everything always feels like it&#39;s at its peak instrumentally... until</p>

<h4>Killing in the Name</h4>

<p>that mf cowbell :O</p>

<p>while the message of this track is its most important aspect... holy shi- the package it comes in is an absolute metal masterpiece :D</p>

<p>the minimalism of the instrumental is by far its greatest strength; de la Rocha&#39;s inflection and general intonation throughout the whole track is insane too ^^</p>

<p>FUCK YOU I WON&#39;T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME</p>

<h4>Take the Power Back</h4>

<p>damn okay, that funk bass introduction is a nice minor change-up; while the vocals here aren&#39;t as transcendentally powerful as the last track (and what is if we’re being honest), it&#39;s much more lyrically dense, which is a great point for it :)</p>

<p>the chorus is almost as catchy- and what a solo and transition into the spoken word sort of piece :O</p>

<p>I&#39;m not as huge a fan of the way the end starts, but it&#39;s at least endearingly powerful ^^</p>

<h4>Settle for Nothing</h4>

<p>I wasn’t completely sold on that minute-long start to the track, but my god what a breakdown; completely jaw-dropping :O</p>

<p>these first four tracks are a stunning start for any album, but especially so for a debut LP of all things ^^</p>

<p>the complete polar opposites of the subtle, nodding verses into the crushing nature of the chorus is an amazing stylistic choice :D</p>

<h4>Bullet in the Head</h4>

<p>some of the little pieces of this record so far have reminded me of RHCP, and this track at its onset is the best example honestly lol</p>

<p>what an amazing guitar section on this track, each section has its own aesthetic and unique aspects that make it all such an earworm :)</p>

<p>OH MY GOD that mf breakdown after the midpoint is INSANE :OOO</p>

<p>I thought that second track was going to carry this LP, but god no, the rest of the tracklist does not need any help yet at all :D</p>

<h4>Know Your Enemy</h4>

<p>god that bridge with Maynard James Keenan is a must-needed respite in this powerful mash-up and application of all the sounds RATM is known for; I don’t think this track is as shockingly memorable as the others but it’s still got the same energy, same message… it’s just as potent :O</p>

<p>and jesus christ that last minute is more INSANE EARWORM SHIT :DD</p>

<h4>Wake Up</h4>

<p>more lyrically dense and intentionally stunning lyrics on this track ^</p>

<p>I think this is the only track on this LP so far where it’s only mainly the strings that stick out; the rest is still good of course, but it’s just a little under the insane curve this record set out with ^^</p>

<p>okay that half-way point is a incredible change-up for this cut, I do like how focused it is on the guitar and bass :)</p>

<p>while it doesn’t have nearly the same inherent stature of Killing in the Name, my god that ending is just as potent :O</p>

<h4>Fistful of Steel</h4>

<p>I don’t really have much else to say here; message is focused and stiff, instrumentals are earworm bangers… every chorus is insanely haunting and memorable, and the spirit of intensity is indescribable ^^</p>

<p>AHHHHHHHH COME ON, HOW‽</p>

<h4>Township Rebellion</h4>

<p>not much else to say here either; it’s still just as hungry and eccentric, but some of the elements are a tinge stale now</p>

<p>the guitar &amp; bass yet again are the shining stars of this cut in all honesty, it’s such an appealing, threatening kind of instrumental ^^^</p>

<p>WHEN IGNORANCE REIGNS, LIFE IS LOST</p>

<p>that’s by far one of the best lines of the whole record, god damn :OO</p>

<h4>Freedom</h4>

<p>that was a great little transition, it feels like the track cut was more-so a moment of silence that re-introduces a very similar, yet uniquely distinctive instrumental style :)</p>

<p>the cohesion of this track’s arc is a bit more confusing, and yes a good amount of the that initial luster is kinda gone; a good instrumental cannot be ignored tho ^</p>

<p>I feel like there could be no different ending to this LP honestly, that chaos in the whole set being mercilessly destroyed is perfect for it all :D</p>
