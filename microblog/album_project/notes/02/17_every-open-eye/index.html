<h2>notes for february 17</h2>

<h1>Every Open Eye by CHVRCHΞS</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Never Ending Circles</h4>

<p>jesus what an opener, I probably should’ve expected what I already knew what was coming given the last LP lol</p>

<p>I do really like this beat and the staccato nature of it (and the nice little vocal samples behind it at times), but sometimes those vocals kinda throw me for a loop ^</p>

<p>okay- but actually for a really good reason, I like this a lot already :)</p>

<p>the ~bass~ :O</p>

<p>honestly this carries the same sort of chaotic, carefully composed energy as their last opener, The Mother We Share</p>

<h4>Leave a Trace</h4>

<p>ahhh okay- I wasn’t feeling this at first, but god the combination of that calmer instrumental and that swap between pleasant and shredding vocal inflection on the chorus is so nice :D</p>

<p>her voice with her intonation is so charismatic, I adore the sort of inflection she has with the little zest her accent adds :)</p>

<p>just an overall lovely track to listen to, great follow-up ^^</p>

<h4>Keep You on My Side</h4>

<p>another really good beat switch up- and again :O</p>

<p>it’s almost a motif of all of their tracks, where the track sort of starts alright, a bit of a change into something more mellow explodes into something loaded with chaotic beauty</p>

<p>this is another one of those examples, even if I don’t think this has reached the peaks of their last record (so far)</p>

<p>it almost feels like a veil is being lifted sometimes when everything comes together, that&#39;s really damn well-made :)</p>

<h4>Make Them Gold</h4>

<p>honestly this one is a bit of a meh for me- it&#39;s nice and had a shiny exterior as always, but I&#39;m not feeling it as much</p>

<p>okay the vocals after the first chorus are really good tho, that sort of small drag turned into something nice</p>

<p>this is one of those deep cuts which are really nice additions to the record, but not nearly as memorable as the main pieces</p>

<h4>Clearest Blue</h4>

<p>there&#39;s the name drop (:</p>

<p>the bass shines a lot on this track for me, I&#39;m liking the slightly different progression of it as a whole; it&#39;s given much more space to stretch through this mellow (for chvrches) sort of theme for a while</p>

<p>holy shit... yea I don&#39;t think that hit the way I was expecting it, but god that slightly off-kilter, pulsating chorus instrumental is insane :O</p>

<h4>High Enough to Carry You Over</h4>

<p>this vocal part by...apologies...not the lead singer- it&#39;s honestly much better and more compelling than the track that was included on their debut :)</p>

<p>unfortunately the only downside is that it serves a sort of mid-point slog forward; it&#39;s not bad by any stretch of the word, but it’s just a subtler, transitionary piece</p>

<h4>Empty Threat</h4>

<p>this goes back to the exciting sort of aesthetic—and maybe it’s just because a bit of the luster of their last LP is gone—but this takes a bit for me to be genuinely interested in</p>

<p>and by the time I’m invested, it’s already the end of the bridge, and the song is fading out already…</p>

<p>I think I’m just having a moment</p>

<h4>Down Side of Me</h4>

<p>yea definitely a moment, especially when I already really like this track with just the introduction :O</p>

<p>god… yup I love this- Mayberry’s vocals in a more toned-down—yet still charismatically synth-heavy track—are just so likeable to my ears with her inflection and styling :D</p>

<h4>Playing Dead</h4>

<p>I do like the very, very retro-sounding synths here, and that chorus 100% slaps hard :)</p>

<p>but I still think a bit of the luster really is gone… I’m not sure, I think I just enjoyed their debut a good amount more than this LP</p>

<h4>Bury It</h4>

<p>the careful simplicity of the start of this cut is really appealing- and my GOD that little after-chorus instrumental is wonderfully ecstatic and comfortable in its craziness :D</p>

<p>I think this honestly reaches the closest to the original love I had for their original LP (and I kind of hate how much I’m comparing them)</p>

<p>because in all honesty, this album is really good… I just for some reason or another cannot shake that initial impression I had :c</p>

<h4>Afterglow</h4>

<p>while I do feel like this is expected, and somehow a bit misplaced, I still like the dedication and consistency with the mellow cuts throughout this tracklist :)</p>

<p>vocals are beautiful as always; and somehow touchingly somber at the end… this was, I think, much better than I’m giving it credit ^^</p>
