<h2>notes for february 10</h2>

<h1>Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven by Godspeed You! Black Emperor</h1>

<hr />

<p>I’m not sure how to go about documenting the feelings and notable moments I have for only four tracks that are each twenty minutes long, but I’ll try, with the sub-songs that wikipedia provides. I’ll just put the sub-song title and its runtime as small title text. but here goes:</p>

<h4>Storm</h4>

<h5>Part I: Lift Yr. Skinny Fists, Like Antennas to Heaven... <em>(6:15)</em></h5>

<p>I really like this slightly somber, partially uplifting, and chillingly bare instrumental opener; once the strings come in it starts feeling much fuller, and it’s such a nice soundscape</p>

<p>it takes almost three and a half minutes for something like that notable to happen, which I think is a testament to how this LP will turn out. it’s gonna be a bit of a trip, and it both won’t be sudden or expected simultaneously</p>

<p>I like the little skipping beat that keeps this going, and while the sound can be monotonous, the fact that the guitar is there to add the detail that it provides is wonderful- and then RIGHT AFTER when there’s horns behind everything :D</p>

<p>legitimately once that sting came in and it all noticeably rose in energy, I got chills, and I can already tell this is going to be such a well-rounded, great experience :)</p>

<p>god I can’t describe how incredible overpowering and exciting that was for just being an instrumental :O</p>

<h5>Part II: Gathering Storm / Il Pleut à Mourir [+Clatters Like Worry] <em>(11:10)</em></h5>

<p>alright that’s a very long, somber sort of sting that keeps going with the guitar- but when it picks up it feels both subtlety terrifying and incredibly meticulous</p>

<p>this is a very hard record to craft, I just hope it turns out well as a cohesive piece ^</p>

<p>jesus, that bass note that went right into the drums and more energetic instrumentation hit so well :O</p>

<p>and I have to compliment those strings behind this all, they pull together this whole piece in such a transcendentally beautiful way :)</p>

<p>I have no idea how this track was able to convert itself into something completely different, but those string hits felt like punches, right before it clicks and subverts itself into this completely different feel at around the 14 minute mark of Storm; it’s kind of incredible honestly, everything feels non-stop, like it’s an entire event</p>

<h5>Part III: ‘Welcome to Arco AM/PM…’ [L.A.X.; 5/14/00] <em>(1:15)</em></h5>

<p>I think I’m at this part of the track now, about 16.5 minutes in; that calculated slowing down of every piece was a really great touch, especially when it ends as the drums feel so tinny and rough</p>

<p>it’s a nice sort of fake-out ending— wait nevermind… NOW it’s this track</p>

<p>I heard the intercom, my bad; just put what I said into the part II section</p>

<h5>Part IV: Cancer Towers on Holy Road Hi-Way <em>(3:52)</em></h5>

<p>that’s a creepy sort of aesthetic coming into this track- I don’t necessarily mesh with that super overblown voice over, but the piano that comes in over it to try and drown out and subdue that piece is really good :)</p>

<p>jesus yea, this is really unsettling with that constant piece behind the piano- a very interesting way to end out this side of this disc</p>

<h4>Static</h4>

<h5>Part I: Terrible Canyons of Static <em>(3:34)</em></h5>

<p>oh my god those synth notes hanging over top of this; the fact that they’re rumbling my entire head just adds to how insanely disconcerting this whole piece is :O</p>

<p>and this ending section of this part is so grossly overblown, but I can’t tell whether it’s a good set-up or just a weird segue</p>

<h5>Part II: Atomic Clock. <em>(1:09)</em></h5>

<p>I think it was a weird segue; that subtle fade into this very soviet-era sounding message would fit perfectly into a horror movie, or a show like Chernobyl</p>

<h5>Part III: Chart #3 <em>(2:39)</em></h5>

<p>jesus christ this sermon behind this string-based instrumental is so terrifying, so unsettling… I don’t know how to conceptualize this at all</p>

<h5>Part IV: World Police and Friendly Fire <em>(9:48)</em></h5>

<p>thank you for the freedom from that</p>

<p>I think the string section in this part speaks for itself, but I think the subtle bass that continues through this thing is what makes it what it is; it’s an interesting, moderately compelling soundscape (especially with the introduction of that xylophone), and I love hearing the progression even if sometimes I don’t like where it’s taking me ^</p>

<p>oh my god… every single time there’s a huge build-up, when the beat finally comes together it’s so damn good :D</p>

<p>huh, and it’s an interesting choice coming back down at the 13 minute mark of the whole track; it could’ve reached even further into a huge crescendo, but it just didn’t</p>

<p>I’m not saying I don’t like what it did though, the low static behind this surprisingly well-made instrumental—with a gorgeous bass line—is a wonderful direction to take :)</p>

<p>god this build-up is killing me… oh my GOD there’s that mf crescendo :O</p>

<p>absolutely jaw-dropping, what the hell</p>

<h5>Part V: […+The Buildings They Are Sleeping Now] <em>(5:25)</em></h5>

<p>this is a much-needed, much-appreciated (I’m sure temporary) cooldown ^</p>

<p>I feel like the cymbals and screeching are the only thing that’s really getting to me here, and providing a notable impact on my brain- up until that big bass drum hit halfway through, but still</p>

<p>the buildings apparently were very much asleep tho</p>

<h4>Sleep</h4>

<h5>Part I: Murray Ostril: ‘...They Don’t Sleep Anymore on the Beach...’ <em>(1:10)</em></h5>

<p>haha this is such a fantastic switch-up, I love this :D</p>

<p>thank god they found him ^</p>

<h5>Part II: Monheim <em>(12:14)</em></h5>

<p>ooh this subtle guitar work is a lovely start to this too; it’s such a somber but interesting aesthetic as a way of initiating the second half of this project</p>

<p>give me the cymbals :)</p>

<p>and okay okay, I was a bit turned off by the way the beat came in at first, but the actual instrumental itself was a bit of a divergence from expectations, so it matches better than I thought it would</p>

<p>I do sort of feel like the guitar meanders just a bit too much during the downturn, but no matter- it still sounds absolutely incredible when it all comes together :D</p>

<p>that one wailing note is a bit over-the-top tho, especially after so long :/</p>

<p>woah okay, complete beat switch up- I’m liking that sort of energy and intonation in this, and the way the whole track sort of lifts itself out from under the wailing guitars ^</p>

<p>jesus christ what a trip; I don’t think I appreciated that section nearly as much as like the ending of Static, but I can’t fault the band for being uninteresting whatsoever</p>

<h5>Part III: Broken Windows, Locks of Love Pt. III. / 3rd Part <em>(9:53)</em></h5>

<p>the triangle ^^^</p>

<p>jesus christ that sting caught me off-guard; and my god if the instrumental that comes after it isn’t wonderful :O</p>

<p>god the part that comes after where it just light strings and guitar, with the very focal drum set… it feels so nice after the journey this record has been, like a little respite tucked away in a corner :)</p>

<p>what a good ending to this side, I love it ^</p>

<h4>Like Antennas to Heaven…</h4>

<h5>Part I: Moya Sings ‘Baby-O’... <em>(1:00)</em></h5>

<p>alright then, was not expecting this stylistic change lol</p>

<h5>Part II: Edgyswingsetacid <em>(0:58)</em></h5>

<p>I have no comment on this instrumental, it just feels weird to my ear canals :O</p>

<h5>Part III: [Glockenspiel Duet Recorded on a Campsite in Rhinebeck, N.Y.] <em>(0:46)</em></h5>

<p>legitimately same thing with this, just sounds cool</p>

<h5>Part IV: ’Attention...Mon Ami...Fa-Lala-Lala-La-La...&#39; [55-St. Laurent] <em>(1:18)</em></h5>

<p>nice little set of samples though; I like the strings that they&#39;re all tied together with through the fading transitions, and the whole aesthetic of it is very nice</p>

<h5>Part V: She Dreamt She Was a Bulldozer, She Dreamt She Was Alone in an Empty Field <em>(9:43)</em></h5>

<p>the use of strings and other instruments like it have been the main driving factor for why I like this record honestly- it&#39;s a great mediating factor with the guitar and drums, and it makes the whole project feel like a postmodern rock opera</p>

<p>holy shi- best beat change of any cut so far; I absolutely love that, and the hugely present bass melody is lovely to my ears :D</p>

<p>and at about the 8:20 mark of the whole track, when the beat resolves itself so nicely—and right before that slightly discordant instrument comes in—god it feels incredible ^</p>

<p>oooh, and that new beat, with the spaced out, warping guitar... every choice on this record, while not perfect, at least feels so deliberate and touching that it&#39;s hard to absolutely love for me :))</p>

<p>this is the best sub-track of the whole record, I adore this so much ^</p>

<h5>Part VI: Deathkamp Drone <em>(3:09)</em></h5>

<p>even just the way that sub-shift happened was lovely- this record is an absolutely incredible experience</p>

<p>the synth sting :O</p>

<h5>Part VII: [Antennas to Heaven…] <em>(2:02)</em></h5>

<p>okay okay, another good change... I feel like these last two sub-tracks aren&#39;t the awe-inspiring wonders of the past few, but they house their own experiences within them</p>

<p>in all honesty they&#39;re not terribly interesting, but I don&#39;t mind all that much- it&#39;s the way it ends is all that matters, and it sticks it amazingly :)</p>
