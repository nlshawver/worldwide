<h2>notes for february 20</h2>

<h1>SATURATION by BROCKHAMPTON</h1>

<hr />

<h4>HEAT</h4>

<p>jesus christ what an introduction :O</p>

<p>some of the bars feel a bit hit or miss, but having such a chunky, driving beat behind all this kinda makes up for it ^</p>

<p>and I can’t hate it for not being emotive and powerfully coarse, oh my god</p>

<p>DAMN that outro was insane; I’m liking this more than I was expecting :O</p>

<h4>GOLD</h4>

<p>this kind of groove and flow after that last track feels so wonderfully foreign and like a pretty nice movement- I like it :)</p>

<p>and damn that chorus is so smooth, I love that with how unique each of these verses are :D</p>

<p>yea that fourth and final verse was so smooth, the rhyme scheme was perfectly done for a track like this ^^</p>

<h4>STAR</h4>

<p>to be honest, while the point of this song is ridiculous, it plays to its strengths really well; I like the constant references and blatant metaphors… and also how direct and personable the last verse is lol</p>

<p>that high-pitched OJ ending was really good too ^</p>

<h4>BOYS</h4>

<p>damn okay, those first two verses are yet again—while not lyrically insane—are just a great stylistic choice for these minimalistic and detailed instrumentals :)</p>

<p>I’ve liked all I’ve heard so far on this LP, this included; it all feels so explosive and filled with energy, I love it ^</p>

<h4>2PAC</h4>

<p>neat little interlude, but that verse didn’t feel like anything standout or special (even if the end does have a greater meaning)</p>

<h4>SKIT 1</h4>

<p>español :O</p>

<h4>FAKE</h4>

<p>while I really like that introductory chorus- I am not feeling that first verse with the pitched vocals at all really :c</p>

<p>I am starting to get way more accustomed to it, and I do get the thematic connection of it… I like that second verse a lot better honestly ^</p>

<p>not bad, it just took a second for me to really feel it :)</p>

<h4>BANK</h4>

<p>that chorus and first verse start to this track are pretty damn good too, this has been a surprisingly good first half to this LP</p>

<p>even that extended refrain is pretty good tbh- and the way it heads into the second verse (and the second verse in general) is good ^</p>

<h4>SKIT 2</h4>

<p>español de nuevo :O</p>

<h4>TRIP</h4>

<p>this honestly has been the only track that’s been just kinda mediocre for me… it’s not anything special compared to the former primary tracks on this record, and it’s just not as compelling a cut to me as the others have been</p>

<p>some of the certain elements of the track are pretty good tho, like the instrumental and more somber(ish) outro, but it’s just not sticking out to me</p>

<h4>SWIM</h4>

<p>huh, the guitars are honestly an interesting change-up- and DAMN that beat introduction is really good :)</p>

<p>I was a bit turned-off by the start of that second verse, but it got a lot better as it went on, and I kinda like it ^</p>

<p>a bit less extreme of a reaction on the third verse, but same; it just feels like a pretty good and laidback sort of track, and I like that aesthetic on this :)</p>

<p>there’s enough unique about it to make it feel special in the tracklist, like the little spurts and cuts of a sample; that’s nice ^</p>

<h4>BUMP</h4>

<p>uhhhh yea not feeling that introduction at all :c</p>

<p>the little chorus and more definable element of the second verse is better to me, but this is still just eh for me :/</p>

<p>damn okay that chorus into the third verse (with that BASS) is honestly pretty good; that’s a much better continuation, and I like that feeling a whole lot more :O</p>

<p>the chorus just feels so different and isolated from the rest lol</p>

<h4>CASH</h4>

<p>alright this song is absolutely wonderful- I think the relatively minimal and cohesive instrumental with these politically charged vocal lines really add up to something greater than the sum of their parts</p>

<p>this was by far the best track since the starting five for me :D</p>

<h4>SKIT 3</h4>

<p>español una vez más :O</p>

<h4>MILK</h4>

<p>while especially the feel of the chorus isn’t all that standout to me, the aesthetic and message of those first two verses was really damn good :)</p>

<p>and while I didn’t like that third verse nearly as much, the way it turns over on itself twice at the end, and transitions so smoothly into the chorus… that was good ^^</p>

<p>that was a very heartfelt and lovingly introspective outro; by far my favorite part of the track, and seriously one of the best moments of the whole LP :O</p>

<h4>FACE</h4>

<p>I don’t really like how it turned into this track, but I think if you were going to transition into any other type of chunky, slightly mellow track- this is the best it could’ve been done ^</p>

<p>and honestly… those first two verses were great, I can’t lie :D</p>

<p>I really do like the sort of anti-climax of the chorus, with such a powerful little beat behind these really nice vocals :)</p>

<p>in a vacuum this is definitely one of my favorites of the LP, very nice; the last verse and chorus were so mf smooth :O</p>

<h4>WASTE</h4>

<p>damnn this shit is smooth as butter :D</p>

<p>this is an absolutely lovely cap to a very chaotic record, I love the layered vocals the most, and how it all just feels like a defiant conclusion to the first third of a year long journey :)</p>
