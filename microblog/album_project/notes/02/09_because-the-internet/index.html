<h2>notes for february 9</h2>

<h1>Because the Internet by Childish Gambino</h1>

<hr />

<h4>The Library (Intro)</h4>

<p>alright then, there is nothing to dissect here other than that&#39;s a cool sound</p>

<h4>I. Crawl</h4>

<p>damn okay- that&#39;s a great instrumental start to this record honestly with such a powerful beat :O</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think he has necessarily the most incredible flow or anything, but I do like Glover&#39;s inflection a lot :)</p>

<p>especially that first verse, that&#39;s pretty damn good ^</p>

<h4>II. Worldstar</h4>

<p>huh okay, I’m not as much of a fan of this… I think</p>

<p>this track goes in between over-bearing and perfectly slick in its styling for me; I like a lot of the aesthetic but some of the lines and a bit of the pounding beat can get to me</p>

<p>like that net twerk line is gross, wth</p>

<p>overall pretty good though, all things said</p>

<h4>Dial Up</h4>

<p>that’s a great little use for an interlude, very nice :)</p>

<h4>I. The Worst Guys (feat. Chance the Rapper)</h4>

<p>woah okay, nice intro so far ^</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tia and Tamera in my bed, I&#39;m a smart guy<br/>I ain&#39;t fucking with you n––s like apartheid (Nah)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>bruhh… that line is the perfect amount of Gambino for me :0</p>

<p>this beat is honestly really damn good imo; it fits Glover’s cadence over it perfectly, and I love the melodic synth/horn sort of thing going on in the backdrop</p>

<p>that was a very subtle Chance feature; and that ending is so damn good, the sort of key change is very deserved :D</p>

<h4>II. Shadows</h4>

<p>I was a bit turned off by the start of this, but after the first verse and the chorus, I’m actually pretty sold on this track :)</p>

<p>I think everything here just sort of meshes in a really simplistic way which is why I’m able to like it; I think some of the bars are way too out there over the last couple tracks, but overall it’s just a good experience</p>

<p>and JESUS that outro was a surprising turn– that’s really damn good honestly</p>

<p>thank u mr thundercat</p>

<h4>III. Telegraph Ave. (“Oakland” by Lloyd)</h4>

<p>alright I think this track kinda starts out slow (not pace-wise, but in terms of likability), but it gets going pretty well</p>

<p>oh for sure; that third verse actually gets this track to a nice little crescendo that sort of tapers off for a while :)</p>

<p>roll credits ^</p>

<h4>IV. Sweatpants</h4>

<p>okay okay, here we go</p>

<p>I think this stretch of tracks that looks like act two—from The Worst Guys to 3005—might be the best set of cuts on this record as a whole especially because of this ending</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Fiskers don&#39;t make noise when they start up, just so you know)<br/>Top of the holy totem<br/>Ri-ri-ri-rich forever, a million was not the quota<br/>My father owned half the MoMA and did it with no diploma</p>
</blockquote>

<p>god this track is just a lovingly crafted, boastful set of rhymes and in-jokes— and I love it :)</p>

<p>is he eatin’ tho?</p>

<h4>V. 3005</h4>

<p>this is such a great ending to this set of five tracks, I adore this one so damn much</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Assassins, I&#39;m stabbed in the back of my cabin<br/>Labrador yapping, I&#39;m glad that it happened, I mean it<br/>Between us, I think there&#39;s something special<br/>And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand<br/>Even if you don&#39;t understand, hol&#39; up</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think it’s necessarily the most interesting, compelling, or creatively adventurous cut… but jesus if it isn’t just a lovely experience to listen to :D</p>

<p>and jesus that beat behind it all is so damn good ^</p>

<p>he is very thirsty :O</p>

<h4>Playing Around Before the Party Starts</h4>

<p>okay that’s a nice little interlude to this; I’ve come to appreciate these interludes a lot since this album project started, and that’s a good placement ^</p>

<h4>I. The Party</h4>

<p>woah alright- this feels like a surprisingly significant shift from the first half of the record</p>

<p>alright at this first verse… my god okay this is damn good :O</p>

<p>I’m caught off guard by how quickly it shifts to the next track, but that was shockingly toned and a pretty good continuation honestly</p>

<h4>II. No Exit</h4>

<p>same for this track, it has the same sort of energy and track through this LP; I love Glover’s lower intonation over this deeply crushing beat :O</p>

<h4>Death by Numbers</h4>

<p>okay yea these transitions have turned this section into a great sort of continuity and sustained energy- I like this :)</p>

<h4>I. Flight of the Navigator</h4>

<p>this intro is a really somber, mellowed-out turn for the LP, and I honestly like the way it shifts, that’s really nice</p>

<p>I’m not as sold on the verses imo, but the chorus is honestly quite touching, and after the first chorus I do think that it keeps that same sort of feeling for me; very powerful track in its stylistic attributes and theme overall ^</p>

<p>I would say I think it keeps going for too long, but with the subtle changes that take place throughout the track and its runtime, it completely deserves the time it gets</p>

<h4>II. Zealots of Stockholm (Free Information)</h4>

<p>another pretty smooth transition, it feels like each section on the record does have a great consistency and sustained but unique theme to each of them ^</p>

<p>hmm okay, I&#39;m not feeling this transition yet</p>

<p>alright that turned it around a bit, and that aggressive section was much more interesting than I was expecting</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And wait &#39;til I&#39;m walkin&#39; in it<br/>With a gun that they 3D printed and finish it<br/>Kinison said, &quot;If you gon&#39; miss Heaven, why do it by two inches?&quot;<br/>Old money and new bitches</p>
</blockquote>

<p>okay that ending was really good honestly- I&#39;m just not really feeling the confusing and constant beat changes all that much; it&#39;s definitely great when it lands, but it just didn&#39;t as much as it went for it</p>

<h4>III. Urn</h4>

<p>honestly just a pretty good interlude sort of track; it didn&#39;t contribute much significantly, but it was a nice small break</p>

<h4>I. Pink Toes (feat. Jhené Aiko)</h4>

<p>honestly same with this track for me- it&#39;s a surprisingly well-structured, slightly mellow track, but it just doesn&#39;t serve as much of a significant purpose that I can tell</p>

<p>Aiko&#39;s contribution is really good though honestly, but this record is dropping in terms of total interest value I think</p>

<h4>II. Earth: The Oldest Computer (The Last Night) [feat. Azealia Banks]</h4>

<p>yea... I&#39;m at the mid-section if this track and I&#39;m just not feeling this :c</p>

<p>it doesn&#39;t feel as cohesive or compelling as the other parts of this record, which is kind of disappointing given the peaks this LP hit ^</p>

<p>I think this ending is at least a bit interesting and energetic, but it feels a bit raw and unseasoned ;/</p>

<h4>III. Life: The Biggest Troll (Andrew Auernheimer)</h4>

<p>I just start to feel like this record could have been better served as an EP, with a more cohesive, shorter runtime to benefit this theme</p>

<p>this track–while pretty good simply because of Glover’s mellow intonation in his bars–seems to just be a subtle change to a concept that’s already been well explored on the record</p>

<p>if this was the only ending, and those sustained synths were what closed this record out without the fluff before it, this would be much, much better imo</p>

<p>because this track is honestly pretty likeable, and has a good sort of tonal cohesion :)</p>

<p>it does kinda falter at the end though, but no matter- this LP has already sealed its end, and it was alright</p>
