<h2>notes for february 25</h2>

<h1>It Was Written by Nas</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Album Intro</h4>

<p>I was a bit thrown off by that introduction, my god lol</p>

<h4>The Message</h4>

<p>hearing those Illmatic era vocals feel kinda weird here ngl; this start to the LP feels interesting and all the bars are constructed and articulated well, but it just doesn’t feel nearly as special or to the same standard as Illmatic</p>

<h4>Street Dreams</h4>

<p>yea and I think this track enforces that, that chorus just kinda feels like a gimmick that doesn’t land very well to me</p>

<p>which sucks, because Nas is incredible at connecting story, flow, and intricately detailed rhymes ^^</p>

<p>even though I think a lot of the time, longer tracks suffer as they go… but honestly I think that track grew on me as it went on; the chorus turned into something that felt way more well-articulated :)</p>

<h4>I Gave You Power</h4>

<p>dude what the hell was that circumcision bar… that just ruined this second section &gt;:(</p>

<p>honestly overall not bad though, I just got so caught off guard by how unnecessary that bar was- and I have to point out that the transitions on this LP so far have been lovely :)</p>

<h4>Watch Dem N––s (feat. Foxy Brown)</h4>

<p>I feel like I have very similar feelings about this record as I do yesterday’s; there’s just something kind of missing, and the LP as a whole just doesn’t feel like it has everything</p>

<p>the lyrics are yet again very appealing, but it just doesn’t stick out a ton :/</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>this was right about when I gave up on these notes and took a nap unfortunately</p>
