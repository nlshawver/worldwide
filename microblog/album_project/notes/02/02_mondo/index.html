<h2>notes for february 2</h2>

<h1>Mondo by Electric Guest</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Holes</h4>

<p>ooh that’s a bit of a weird introduction, but I cannot yet tell whether it’s interesting or just chaotic for the sake of it</p>

<p>honestly the lyrics are pretty compelling, and this serves as a good introduction I think— not bad at all :)</p>

<h4>This Head I Hold</h4>

<p>especially when the next song is this ^^</p>

<p>it is a bit of a muzak, lobby sort of song, but it is pretty catchy and compelling as just a simplistic melody :)</p>

<p>I do think the chorus is almost symbolic, and doesn’t really represent anything significant, but the verses at least have some personality on their bones</p>

<h4>Under the Gun</h4>

<p>the same cannot be said about this track though, at least right now; the introduction just feels like scrap, and it just feels like filler :/</p>

<p>that chorus actually has potential I think, the layered vocals sound smooth and silky… but when it goes back to these verses, I just feel off-put</p>

<p>this outro feels gross too, with the marching drums and the background synths not really being interesting at all</p>

<h4>Awake</h4>

<p>wait okay this isn’t bad at all- I really like those layered vocals and the way they travel around the melody; I feel like this will be a theme, where sometimes the tracks hit pretty well, and the rest just fall flat for me</p>

<p>yea, and that outro was pretty mellow, and had an interesting aesthetic (even if I’m not a huge fan of those synths at the end)</p>

<p>it’s a very passable indie pop track, but I hate to say that that’s probably the peak of this record :c</p>

<h4>Amber</h4>

<p>okay that chorus is pretty good with those Danger Mouse synths ^^</p>

<p>I just feel like the verses are kinda milquetoast; while I like the double entendre between amber being a person and the tree amber, it just feels uninteresting by the second verse</p>

<p>that key change was a good ending, but I can’t help but feel like it was not earned at all :c</p>

<p>this definitely isn’t a bad track, it becomes more interesting after its midpoint, but it’s just not all that interesting</p>

<h4>The Bait</h4>

<p>ohhh I know this one too- honestly this isn’t bad either, it just feels incredibly sterile</p>

<p>and that’d be an interesting style if it was both intentional and the music or theme was compelling in that style… it’s just not very</p>

<h4>Waves</h4>

<p>yea and this one’s even worse for me; it’s so grossly over-done, the vocals don’t really match, and this fake sort of melody is just tiring :/</p>

<p>I’ve been pretty checked out of listening for at least ten minutes now</p>

<p>and that perfectly describes the aesthetic and (lack of) energy on this record for me</p>

<h4>Troubleman</h4>

<p>okay exactly- this first half of this long track is actually kinda nice, and probably the most intriguing portion of this backend-</p>

<p>but it just should have ended at the halfway point… because of this second part I just completely forget everything of how we got here, and the story that’s attempted here just doesn’t land for me :c</p>

<p>the fact that I’m waiting for this track to be done shows how compelling it is; there are plenty of artists that can make an eight minute track worthwhile, interesting, and overall a great experience that you remember</p>

<p>none of this sticks with me, and that is exactly the problem</p>

<h4>American Daydream</h4>

<p>nope to all of this</p>

<p>that first verse with the weird, dissonant layered vocals, and the plucky synth under it just don’t hit with me</p>

<p>and it continues throughout the whole track</p>

<p>oh my GOD even the lead singer (who is the brother of the guy FROM THE LONELY ISLAND) sounds disinterested- why do you expect me to be happy about listening to this when you don’t even want to be here, wth</p>

<h4>Control</h4>

<p>yea I’ll stop, you get the vibe of my thoughts</p>

<p>GET RID OF THE RIDE CYMBAL</p>
