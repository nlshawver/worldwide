<h1>mini notes for endtroducing</h1>

<ul>
	<li>the bass sample from orion was what got me really appreciating the sampling work on this record :O</li>
	<li>I don’t really have much to say honestly; the sample work here is very well-articulated and styled in the perfect kind of way</li>
	<li>I just can’t help but think that so much of this record is tied with its reputation; it certainly influenced a great many musicians, but it’s just not connecting with me to that shining, flawless level that so many other publications and reviewers think of it</li>
</ul>
