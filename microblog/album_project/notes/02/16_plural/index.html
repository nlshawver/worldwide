<h2>notes for february 16</h2>

<h1>Plural by Electric Guest</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Zero</h4>

<p>I kind of regret putting Electric Guest on here, but I&#39;m hoping the consistency of this record makes up for whatever the last one was</p>

<p>this intro isn&#39;t the best start- but honestly the chorus is pretty good ^</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t really like the horns, and the synth work is just passable... but it is a nice groove, and I wouldn&#39;t not like hearing this on a car ride</p>

<p>don&#39;t really get that ending :/</p>

<h4>Glorious Warrior</h4>

<p>okay this is the perfect sort of pop that I&#39;d expect from something like this- I don&#39;t think the synths are anything incredible, and same goes for the vocals... but it just feels like bubblegum, and that&#39;s a great vibe to go for :)</p>

<p>the chorus just feels so nice, which is why I like this song the most on this record ^^</p>

<h4>Back &amp; Forth</h4>

<p>yea not feeling this instrumental as much especially on the introduction, but I&#39;ll let it ride itself forward</p>

<p>honestly, while a good amount of this is confusing in its structure, it has a pleasant sort of uplifting aesthetic, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all that bad at all</p>

<h4>Dear To Me</h4>

<p>this one has a similar energy to me, but I think this one falters a bit more; the chorus is way less compelling than Back &amp; Forth, and while some of the light piano synth is interesting, the primary instrumental is just sort of like white bread</p>

<p>it&#39;s alright, but it&#39;s nothing really all that special or endearing on its own</p>

<p>ngl the end of the verse and chorus do lightly slap tho ^</p>

<h4>Oh Devil</h4>

<p>ehhh not feeling this one at all :c</p>

<p>it’s just one of those very generic, kinda gross and over-produced pop songs that I don’t really care for</p>

<p>and jesus I feel queasy with that chorus, probably a canyon in this record to me :/</p>

<h4>Back For Me</h4>

<p>this track isn’t much better tbh; the single snare being the only binding instrumental here is sickeningly monotonous</p>

<p>and while bits and individual motifs in the chorus aren’t terrible, it’s just kind of a bore, and not really all that substantive imo; it’s not bad, just very forgettable :/</p>

<h4>See the Light</h4>

<p>okay honestly this instrumental is not bad; it’s certainly nothing outstanding, but the more mellow aesthetic is pretty good for the LP as a whole</p>

<p>the clock ticking isn’t my favorite though, and while some of the vocalizations aren’t all that bad, the weird inclusion of the sole cymbal kinda throws me out</p>

<h4>Over</h4>

<p>the drumbeat here is pretty passable, but this track just feels like a bit of a lull to me ^</p>

<p>the little bridge and chorus is definitely pretty good; which seems to be the theme of this LP to me– occasional spots of genuinely alright synth pop laced with almost sickeningly sterile maroon-five-esque indie pop</p>

<h4>My Omen</h4>

<p>nope, not really feeling this introduction; and the actual feel of the track when it gets into it feels virtually identical to the rest of this record, since it’s not really showing anything new to me at this point</p>

<p>it’s a little checked out, not really interested in itself anymore… yea it just kind of ends like it never started or happened in the first place, like it was never supposed to be here</p>

<h4>Sarah</h4>

<p>mmm not sure about this piano… and while a sort of retro drum beat can be interesting in all honesty, this just feels uncooked and unseasoned, not really providing anything useful alongside the steamed broccoli that is that drum beat</p>

<p>god that chorus is gross, and it just sort of drags itself forward through dusty shelves by the end; that drum line was the only interesting part of this :c</p>

<h4>Bound To Lose</h4>

<p>nope, sounds like baby surf rock at the onset</p>

<p>it doesn’t even seem like this is meant to be an ending or conclusion to the record; you could throw this into the middle and it would fit just as well</p>

<p>I don’t really have anything else to say… this started off as a better, average sort of record but it just kept sliding down a hill of mismanaged and over-blown concepts</p>
