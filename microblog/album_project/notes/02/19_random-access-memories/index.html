<h2>notes for february 19</h2>

<h1>Random Access Memories by Daft Punk</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Give Life Back to Music</h4>

<p>honestly I don’t think there’s much to say here- this record feels like something of what Silk Sonic is, where it’s a modern interpretation and love letter to the peak genres and stylings of 70’s and 80’s music</p>

<p>and this is a really good opener to set that stage :)</p>

<h4>The Game of Love</h4>

<p>the typical daft punk vocals really make this feel unique and special though, I love the aesthetic :)</p>

<p>god I love this track- the subtle and expressive drum beat, the little vocal harmonizing and lovely bass line behind it all… absolutely wonderful stuff :D</p>

<p>definitely the best track of this introduction to the record ^</p>

<h4>Giorgio by Moroder</h4>

<p>I love that extended vocal line, it feels like a very personable, expressive way to earn a bit of a connection to this track; and the instrumental that follows it is a nice mix of drum and bass work, and that stunning, warbling synth :D</p>

<p>great little rhodes solo :)</p>

<p><em>damn</em> that drop, so hungry with the high strings and drum combo :O</p>

<p>that was a great little journey through so many sounds and little improvisations, I loved that ^</p>

<h4>Within</h4>

<p>aww I thought was gonna be the sickest transition ever... the piano&#39;s still really nice after that tho</p>

<p>and yet again the vocals (along with some rly nice bass and drum sections that feel kinda chunky) make this such a great downtempo sort of track</p>

<p>lovely little pause from last track&#39;s action :)</p>

<h4>Instant Crush (feat. Julian Casablancas)</h4>

<p>okay I was just kinda grooving to this at first, with yet again some great drums and bass... but <em>damn</em> that chorus is SO damn good :D</p>

<p>the vocals just feel so wavey and pleasant; it&#39;s so good with all these synth leads :)</p>

<p>definitely my favorite track on this LP so far ^</p>

<h4>Lose Yourself to Dance (feat. Pharrell Williams)</h4>

<p>jesus that is such a heavy, stunning guitar riff draped over this instrumental :O</p>

<p>and pharrell was a perfect choice for this record, his voice is unsurprisingly fitting with this style</p>

<p>this just feels like a retro revival even by daft punk standards, and it works so damn well :)</p>

<h4>Touch (feat. Paul Williams)</h4>

<p>damn what an introduction- that creeping sort of soundscape is a great choice into this way more rock-ish sound in a way</p>

<p>OH SHIT that piano; this just feels decadent, and a little out of left field... but it&#39;s such a good change up imo :)</p>

<p>that was overall way better than I expected, and the final, cut-off crescendo was so damn well-made :O</p>

<h4>Get Lucky (feat. Pharrell Williams)</h4>

<p>I mean... what can I say about this track that anyone doesn&#39;t already know</p>

<p>this is such a staple of the time; the nostalgia and merit of this track I think match due to how good I think this song actually is :D</p>

<p>it just slaps so damn hard (:</p>

<h4>Beyond</h4>

<p>what is this, super smash bros brawl?</p>

<p>okay but honestly though, this develops into a pleasantly mellow instrumental, with those lovely vocoded(?) vocal lines :)</p>

<p>the feel of the latter half of this record is wonderful, and this is a great continuation of it, especially after last track&#39;s energy ^</p>

<h4>Motherboard</h4>

<p>woah that acoustic guitar is a surprisingly fitting addition, especially with the extra strings which I love too :O</p>

<p>da clarinet ^^</p>

<p>EHHH while I&#39;m still grossed out by how liquid and viscous that sounds, the little beat break, pause, and touching synth leads that introduce it again are lovely :)</p>

<h4>Fragments of Time (feat. Todd Edwards)</h4>

<p>damn what a groove... this record really is a neatly packaged love letter, it&#39;s so well crafted and emotive :)</p>

<p>plus the bass is incredible, so I can&#39;t not like it this much</p>

<p>THE VOCALS AND BEAT TOGETHER :D</p>

<p>what a great track, and it leads right into...</p>

<h4>Doin’ It Right (feat. Panda Bear)</h4>

<p>this is the most true-to-discovery track on this thing, and it slaps SO HARD with that low bass note</p>

<p>it legitimately shakes my soul with that hit; it&#39;s such a fantastic, lovable cut of this LP :D</p>

<p>and Panda Bear&#39;s vocals and lyrics in general are a really good fit for this aesthetic, they mesh perfectly to my ears :)</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>holy shit, what a fantastic vocal sample ^^</p>

<p>these ethereal chord changes are wonderful, I don&#39;t even know what to say... but ngl was not expecting the drums to be that uptempo and energetic :O</p>

<p>oh my god, what a mf crescendo even though it&#39;s still going(...?) the washed out chaos of the synths is almost haunting ^</p>

<p>and that&#39;s all we&#39;re left with at the end... that sounded completely alien and insanely charged with energetic wonder, what the hell :O</p>
