<h2>notes for february 6</h2>

<h1>Debut by Björk</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Human Behaviour</h4>

<p>woah… I don’t even know how to describe the feeling of this opener</p>

<p>I love the timpani as the primary driver of the instrumental, but jesus the vocals are both incredibly satisfying and haunting at the same time</p>

<p>it’s a weird mix that I can’t really get over; it’s a very compelling opener to this record</p>

<h4>Crying</h4>

<p>AH that piano line is somehow so damn catchy :D</p>

<p>I can’t help but think that’s the primary compelling part of this song- but the verses are actually pretty well-articulated and her voice is more surprisingly powerful than I was initially expecting</p>

<p>and that chorus has actually gotten to me, that’s good :)</p>

<p>that ending, with the bridge and chorus filling out the vocals, and that instrumental finishing it off with her vocalizing- that’s pretty damn good ^</p>

<h4>Venus as a Boy</h4>

<p>huh, interesting little instrumental- I don’t know how sold I am on the aesthetic of the starting of this record, but I can’t deny how artistically free this sounds</p>

<p>and I love the chorus and how natural the unintelligible parts of it all sound :)</p>

<h4>There’s More to Life Than This</h4>

<p>woah, I can’t not appreciate these instrumentals- but I’m both intrigued and taken aback by the vocals of this track</p>

<p>it’s certainly an interesting aesthetic, and it serves itself well to that, but I’m just not feeling it right now I guess</p>

<p>woah okay, that was an offsetting, captivating little takedown in the middle; I can definitely appreciate the energy and artistry of this, but this track just didn’t stick out as much</p>

<h4>Like Someone in Love</h4>

<p>huh okay, I love the subtle instrumentation of this track, the detail of the backdrop- and her vocals are lovely over top of all of it :)</p>

<p>genuinely might be my favorite track so far, it just feels so lovely while developing into this chaotic set of emotions</p>

<h4>Big Time Sensuality</h4>

<p>alright alright, there’s a kind of simplistic appeal to this track; it’s certainly not my favorite, but it has a sort of interesting energy</p>

<p>I’m not a huge fan of the expressive yelling, but that’s a personal preference I guess</p>

<h4>One Day</h4>

<p>yea, this is another one where I really like the styling of the instrumental- and while I was initially not as compelled by the vocals, the midsection of the track was way more appealing and had both subtle and grand sections that sounded really nice :)</p>

<p>overall a really good track on this record; I’m just struggling to figure out how I really feel about this record</p>

<h4>Aeroplane</h4>

<p>and another absolutely lovely, mysterious instrumental :O</p>

<p>holy shit that second verse was insane- that was the lyrical peak for me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How come out of all the people in the world<br/>Only one can make me complete?<br/>One word, one word on the phone<br/>Makes me happy<br/>One touch, but one touch directly<br/>Makes me ecstatic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>what a captivating, incredibly well done track- and I think that’s the general feeling I get from this record</p>

<p>I’m off-put and uninterested in some of the vocal lines and some of the intonation of the record… but there’s sometimes here that blow my mind, and show such a compelling element to them</p>

<h4>Come to Me</h4>

<p>like this as well, this instrumental is incredible- <em>and</em> I also really love these vocals :O<br/>I think this is a really good follow-up track to Aeroplane- the energy and cohesive of both of them match well enough, but they have distinctions that keep them unique</p>

<h4>Violently Happy</h4>

<p>okay wow, these last three(ish) tracks are all really well done, and they all mesh with my senses in a subtly powerful sort of way… I think I’m finally appreciative of this LP, the onset just set me off-kilter</p>

<p>god that bass line is so punchy, and everything else fits well in context of this piece as a contextual piece of this record</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Violently happy<br/>I&#39;m driving my car<br/>Too fast<br/>With ecstatic music on</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yea go for it :)</p>

<p>I also really like the meaning of the lyrics and how they shape as a sort of crazed love story of pure attachment</p>

<h4>The Anchor Song</h4>

<p>I wonder how this will wrap things up?</p>

<p>oh it’s a horn section on a boat; I’m gonna tip the buskers</p>

<p>okay in all honesty this is somehow a sort of fitting end; it’s perfect in its expected unexpectedness (besides when looking at the title), and Björk’s vocals just fit the best with me over minimal instrumentals I think</p>

<p>that last note is the best btw, obviously</p>

<p>the expression just feels more raw and emotive- so this track is a good ending to this LP :)</p>
