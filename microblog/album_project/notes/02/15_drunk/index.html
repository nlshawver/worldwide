<h2>notes for february 15</h2>

<h1>Drunk by Thundercat</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Rabbot Ho</h4>

<p>oh my god the little thunder behind the track genuinely shook me a bit :O</p>

<h4>Captain Stupido</h4>

<p>hahaha that OPENING LINE :D</p>

<p>I love the energy of this piece already, it feels monotonous in its repetitiveness but so weirdly compelling in what’s actually being mentioned in the mini-choruses</p>

<h4>Uh Uh</h4>

<p>that chaotic little blast into the main instrumental is such a damn good groove, I like the energy it provides; and god the sample plays into the bass and piano racing forward so damn well, that was a great little instrumental</p>

<h4>Bus In These Streets</h4>

<p>I do like the non-subtle-at-all message in this track, and I think the instrumental serves it well- especially as a continuation of the thematic choice of the past instrumental track</p>

<h4>A Fan’s Mail (Tron Song Suite II)</h4>

<p>honestly this record so far has felt like masterful little appetizers, not for too long teasing some great theme in single place- and I think that kind of suits the record well, since each of these instrumentals—while fundamentally similar—have their own interesting specific qualities that really add to the the overall aesthetic of the LP</p>

<h4>Lava Lamp</h4>

<p>okay by far I think this track has the most compelling and interesting vocal lyrics and intonations— I love the mellow wave Bruner’s vocals ride over and through this track (especially with the sitar-esque instrument inclusion)</p>

<p>great build-up in theme of the record :)</p>

<h4>Jethro</h4>

<p>and while I still don’t fully understand the usage of so many short tracks, I do really like how they feel included with the tracks that precede and succeed them, while still being distinct bites to chew on</p>

<p>this is one of my favorite examples of that so far, especially with the spacious vocals</p>

<h4>Day &amp; Night</h4>

<p>that one was too quick to even talk about though, wth</p>

<h4>Show You The Way (feat. Michael McDonald &amp; Kenny Loggins)</h4>

<p>what a weird but compelling mash-up of different artists; Kenny’s part is actually a pretty good change-up from all Bruner’s vocals, and same with McDonald (even if both feel like sidesteps from the primary drive of the record)</p>

<p>I’m not sure I’m a great fan of this track, but it’s still interesting, and the chorus with the typical Thundercat bass and vocal mix-ups</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey, how&#39;s it going? This is your boy, Thundercat. If you&#39;re going to fill your water bottle with vodka, always make sure you have a friend with a bottle that actually has water in it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that’s a great vocal outro though, I love that :D</p>

<h4>Walk On By (feat. Kendrick Lamar)</h4>

<p>the very plastic sounding drums are both a strength and interesting step on this record, but I am intrigued by the super washed and warped synth harmony in between the vocal lines and bass—</p>

<p>and yea of course this is the most interesting track on this LP so far- both because of the laid-back vocals, but because Kendrick is on the track</p>

<p>that verse, while mellow and soft in its delivery—outside of Kendrick’s usual vocal style—is genuinely really good, and fits well despite being a feature that usually provides more bold and charged bars</p>

<h4>Blackkk</h4>

<p>I like the little heavenly sounding vocal lines, and the sort of improvisation on each of the primary instruments is a nice touch- pretty good (yet again) short track ^</p>

<h4>Tokyo</h4>

<p>alright alright- the sort of galloping drum beat and deeper register of Thundercat’s vocals is a really good combination imo</p>

<p>it’s a grossly over-the-top in some of the lyrics, but it just feels right for some reason- it matches well with the aesthetic of all the vocals up to this point, so it just kinda comes off well</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Goku fucking ruined me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>good ending :)</p>

<h4>Jameel’s Space Ride</h4>

<p>HAHAHA I absolutely adore the first verse of this thing :D</p>

<p>god it’s just a trip, and that emphatic “FUCK YEAH” just comes off so juvenile and playful, and in such an endearing way :)</p>

<h4>Friend Zone</h4>

<p>TURN THE ALARM OFF please ;(</p>

<p>incredibly classic sounding bass line under this thing though, what a mf groove; I do really like the sometimes jarring lines in the lyrics (and nice mr kung fu break)</p>

<p>okay I almost wrote this track off in the way it started, but the sampling and overall instrumentation is wonderful- this is one of the better tracks on this thing for sure :)</p>

<h4>Them Changes</h4>

<p>certified classic®</p>

<p>I don’t really know what else can be said about this track that hasn’t already been said- great sample, infectious bass line, lovely and floaty vocal lines, and such a fantastic culmination of all of those aspects :)</p>

<p>I’ll definitely go back in the future and figure how this record works more personally into itself, instead of just waiting for this track, but for now… it’s hard not to be excited by this thing ^</p>

<h4>Where I’m Going</h4>

<p>honestly that’s a great, rumbling bass line follow-up to the previous track- I’m a bit off-put by the way it continues after it though, but it is a bit of a build-up-hype machine</p>

<p>and that incredibly driving bass drum in the drum line is a really good underlying piece to this track, that was pretty good ^^</p>

<h4>Drink Dat (feat. Wiz Khalifa)</h4>

<p>did not expect Wiz Khalifa to fit so well on this honestly :O</p>

<p>ooh and that transition back into the chorus felt so nice; the features list on this thing feels perfectly well-adjusted, and compliments weaving in between and out of the solo pieces by Thundercat so well :)</p>

<p>Bruner’s vocals on this are yet again really damn good, I love the inflection he has, and the actual content of his words are interesting in relation to the mini-plot of the track</p>

<h4>Inferno</h4>

<p>really nice sounding string introduction- but jesus that change-up into the shredding, synth-oriented sort of beat is absolutely wonderful :D</p>

<p>I have no idea how that was four minutes; I think the cohesion in the creation of this record compliments the 51 minute runtime to feel like such a quick release… or it certainly feels like it to me</p>

<p>and of course this track was damn good too, this is another personal favorite for me ^</p>

<h4>I Am Crazy</h4>

<p>alright then, I understand</p>

<h4>3AM</h4>

<p>these bite-sized portions at the end I think honestly really compliment the way this LP will fade away; it’s a few hills to sweep through before settling and relaxing down in a valley away from the peaks this record hit</p>

<h4>Drunk</h4>

<p>and the unsettling, yet incredibly relatable lyrical passages in each track serve to compliment that method as well</p>

<p>it makes them very personable, and incredibly connecting in the way they give an aspect out to the listener (the listener is me)</p>

<h4>The Turn Down (feat. Pharrell Williams)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh &#39;cause look at the mess we&#39;ve made<br/>Who&#39;s gonna clean it up?<br/>Oh my God, where&#39;s Captain Planet?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>pour one out for a real 1 ;(</p>

<p>oh my god all of Pharrell’s verse is damn good, I was not expecting that at all :O</p>

<p>it kind of cuts out suddenly out from under the whole track, but that was a really good stop by at the corner for a conversation with him :)</p>

<h4>DUI</h4>

<p>woah… just with the meaning of the track and how well this instrumental fits in with Bruner’s vocals and the aesthetic achieved throughout this whole record… it’s so damn well done</p>

<p>god that ending is incredible; I love it :)</p>
