<h2>notes for february 21</h2>

<h1>Wolf by Tyler, the Creator</h1>

<hr />

<h4>WOLF</h4>

<p>alright I already really like this- it&#39;s somehow a really charming and ridiculous introduction, especially with the huge strings and everything else that made the instrumental</p>

<p>the rest was weird, but-</p>

<h4>Jamba (feat. Hodgy Beats)</h4>

<p>it&#39;s a great thematic change into this over-the-top, incredibly aggressive beat and lyrics :O</p>

<p>and holy shi- that feature verse is insane, and it forms the track into something charmingly teenage in nature- and overall a great style start :D</p>

<p>I know tyler&#39;s flow isn&#39;t insane, but I love his style in general; that outro was a good amount of funny ^</p>

<h4>Cowboy</h4>

<p>I don&#39;t think the verses here are as well-articulated as they were on Jamba, but the way they stutter into the chorus is actually really good ^^</p>

<p>bruh those doo doo and caca lines before the third chorus, wth lmao</p>

<h4>Awkward</h4>

<p>the actual message and lyrics of this track fit really nicely into this LP (and that instrumental is honestly rly good with that cute small synth)... but I&#39;m not feeling the pitch-downed vocal style in a vacuum</p>

<p>in the context of the record tho, yea, this is honestly pretty good :)</p>

<h4>Domo23</h4>

<p>damn okay, jesus christ— tyler definitely matured a bit, and while I think there is a certain appeal for this style, it does feel intentionally juvenile</p>

<p>and it&#39;s just an extreme version of some of the themes of the LP already presented; the sample and style started off fresh and really startling, but if it ended any later I would&#39;ve gotten sick of it</p>

<h4>Answer</h4>

<p>I do like this more introspective yet obviously aggressive tone, and the lyrics certainly add to that sense :O</p>

<p>this is one of my favorite tracks on this LP so far honestly, the length allows Tyler to pretty much stretch out lyrically... and I love what comes from it :)</p>

<h4>Slater (feat. Frank Ocean)</h4>

<p>damn, really must&#39;ve been more dope than the knees :O</p>

<p>this track doesn&#39;t necessarily stick out as much too me, but it does feel like a compelling little part of this half of the record; just not my favorite or least favorite at all</p>

<h4>48</h4>

<p>that was a sick little transition into this smooth as butter beat, I love that :D</p>

<p>more appealing lyrical flow and content on this track, this is definitely my favorite individual track and moment on the LP so far, even if those few cuts at the beginning were really solid ^^</p>

<h4>Colossus</h4>

<p>I think I might know the theme of this track... hmmm</p>

<p>I do like the really obvious story being drawn out here, and I think it fits really nicely after 48 :)</p>

<p>the instrumental is very tyler too, very nice- and jesus this track keeps going and going thematically lol</p>

<p>HE DIDN&#39;T EVEN TAKE THE PICTURE</p>

<h4>PartyIsntOver / Campfire / Bimmer (feat. Lætitia Sadier and Frank Ocean)</h4>

<p>this is a clear three part track, and I do like the interlude nature of that first part- it&#39;s a nice little relaxation after Colossus</p>

<p>but honestly the rest of this, being all of Campfire and Bimmer... it just feels derivative and a bit unnecessary; it doesn&#39;t seem to add much</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they&#39;re bad at all, especially with Frank Ocean at the tail end, it&#39;s just painful indifference :/</p>

<h4>IFHY (feat. Pharrell Williams)</h4>

<p>I haven’t mentioned it yet, but I do kinda like the storyline of this record and the very definite meaning its meant to portray; I think it’s surprisingly endearing, but I just don’t connect as much with the actual cuts that make up the record</p>

<p>the instrumentals are usually good and same with the vocals… but this track is definitely not one of my favorites :c</p>

<p>the best moment is definitely the end of that first verse tho; while Pharrell’s vocals are really damn good, I don’t think the verse he takes up is particularly special (even if the ending is really nice)</p>

<h4>Pigs</h4>

<p>this is another track with one of those very chunky, kinda discordant instrumentals with very meaningful lyrics- I like parts and pieces, but it’s just not fantastic at times :(</p>

<p>I’m just offset constantly between careful acceptance and tinged indifference on this record; this third verse is not helping :c</p>

<p>like the lyrics are surprisingly really good at times… but it’s just so damn mf grating at too many times consistently</p>

<h4>Parking Lot (feat. Casey Veggies and Mike G)</h4>

<p>oh shit okay, that Mike G verse is really good :)</p>

<p>yet again the rest of the track is just kinda sitting there for me though tbh ^</p>

<p>that mixed mutt line tho, bruh :O</p>

<h4>Rusty (feat. Domo Genesis and Earl Sweatshirt)</h4>

<p>okay okay, the Domo Genesis start is surprisingly good, especially with this pretty appealing, suspenseful sort of instrumental behind it all :O</p>

<p>and jesus christ that super long Tyler verse is both shocking and lovingly detailed, introspective in its methods… this is the best track on the record for me, especially compared to how mediocre the lead-up to this has been</p>

<p>all three verses on here are insane, Earl is a master; but jesus that ending…</p>

<h4>Trashwang (feat. Left Brain, Na&#39;kel, Jasper, Taco, L-Boy, Lucas and Lee Spielman)</h4>

<p>yea not feeling the start of this, the repetition just destroys how well-formed and introspectively beautiful Rusty was for me :c</p>

<p>also I’m sorry, the features on this track so far are not good; it sounds like a bad parody of a cut off Flockaveli</p>

<p>Lucas Vercetti what the hell are you doing… this is really not great :ccc</p>

<h4>Treehome95 (feat. Erykah Badu and Coco Owino)</h4>

<p>dude the cohesion of this record is insanely confusing; this cut is absolutely beautiful and interestingly toned with the chaotic synths above the first half… I just don’t understand how something so gross like Trashwang leads into this really pretty-sounding, jazz-influenced track ???</p>

<p>that bridge call out is really damn good, and the bridge is the peak of this track :D</p>

<h4>Tamale</h4>

<p>okay and this track is just hilarious; the sample is an insane earworm, the lyrics are so maniacal yet smooth… a surprising track after the last, but it’s not like it sticks out from the rest of the record honestly ^^</p>

<p>the verses are honestly really well crafted and interesting in their vulgar qualities; that bass line is insane too :O</p>

<h4>Lone</h4>

<p>just a kinda subtle beat, not bad start to the end; that old-time, scratchy sample by the mid-section is really good too :)</p>

<p>and wow, this has one of the best lyrical themes and progressions of the whole record; some of the peaks of this record are so high, but it’s dragged down SO HARD at times by the other tracks</p>

<p>but anyways: what an ending… it fits perfectly well, and it caps off the track surprisingly well :)</p>
