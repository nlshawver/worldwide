<h2>notes for february 5</h2>

<h1>InnerSpeaker by Tame Impala</h1>

<hr />

<h4>It Is Not Meant To Be</h4>

<p>damn okay, that simple guitar line over this instrumental is a really nice start, I like this so far :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But, in all honesty, I don&#39;t have a hope in hell<br/>I&#39;m happy just to watch her move</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ooh I really like that chorus and the echoing filter over Parker’s voice, it really makes the aesthetic of this opener ^</p>

<p>guys I think Tame Impala is good :O</p>

<h4>Desire Be Desire Go</h4>

<p>hm, I don’t know entirely why, but that clipping guitar line sounds really good to me :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t have the verve to belong to this dead side<br/>Why I ever tried, I, I don&#39;t know<br/>Oh, dare I face the real world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>jesus, even though they’re mixed and faded a bit into the background of the instrumental, the vocal lines here are surprisingly endearing and emotive</p>

<h4>Alter Ego</h4>

<p>alright alright, I really like the horn-style synths on the onset of this track, it’s an absolutely lovely, trance-like styling :D</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That you are all you&#39;re meant to be<br/>When the one from my dream<br/>Is sitting right next to me<br/>And I don&#39;t know what to do<br/>Oh, alter ego</p>
</blockquote>

<p>holy- that chorus is so damn well done, especially with how it pitches down over time, and everything that goes into this track</p>

<p>it all meshes so well together, I adore this track :)</p>

<h4>Lucidity</h4>

<p>god this feels so crunchy in my ears :O</p>

<p>oh shit, I love that second verse a lot- the playful chaotic nature of all of this feels so personal and timeless</p>

<p>I love the little come back into the thematic chorus of the track after a pause, it adds to the general feeling of the track as a whole I think</p>

<h4>Why Won’t You Make Up Your Mind?</h4>

<p>I like more defined, clear sounding synth that tracks back and forth by your head through this song- and I like how the drums feel marching forwards but not into anything dull or monotonous</p>

<p><em>especially</em> with that crispy, rough guitar :D</p>

<h4>Solitude Is Bliss</h4>

<p>all of these tracks have felt so nice to the ear, each with a definable motif that keeps the general theme similar, while remaining–as a cohesive unit–stunningly interesting</p>

<p>and I love the stuttering swagger of this track, it feels so show-off-y in a likeable way :)</p>

<p>also just have to say: I have loved each and every bass instrumental in this whole LP so far (just to be reassuring)</p>

<h4>Jeremy’s Storm</h4>

<p>hmm, I’m liking the slightly jazz-y instrumentation behind the primary guitar line- and I like how this is in essence a long interlude</p>

<p>it splits things up nicely, and it serves as like a midpoint, transition-type interim before the remainder of the record</p>

<p>I guess it’s a good thing these sweeping, miniature synth pieces mesh so well with this increasingly diverse soundscape :)</p>

<h4>Expectation</h4>

<p>catchy and surprising little offset piece to start, you could say it has SUBVERTED MY EXPECTATION(S)</p>

<p>but yea anyways- this just seemed like the status quo in terms of this record (which is in no way a bad thing, it’s just the closest thing to a track that blends in for me so far)</p>

<p>I do like how the track fades and comes back for a bit; it’s nothing incredible, but it certainly upped the chaotic nature of this instrumentation in particular :O</p>

<p>and then it just ends on a simple chord lol</p>

<h4>The Bold Arrow of Time</h4>

<p>jesus, I was already impressed with the starting of this song, but that driving guitar riff and following solo are so crushing</p>

<p>the energy of this track is a fantastic lead up to the finish line for this LP, I love this track :)</p>

<p>huh, weird little interlude at the end, kinda touching but a bit of an interesting inclusion</p>

<h4>Runaway, Houses, City, Clouds</h4>

<p>okay I’m already getting excited for this track, the fade in is doing it for me</p>

<p>god I love every little addition that this given soundscape gives; those haunting synth melodies, the infectious guitar riff- it just feels so charming and ethereal altogether ^</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But don&#39;t remind me of home<br/>In case it isn&#39;t quite the same</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and what a lyrically eminent ending- with all the instrumental that comes after, the fuzziness of this track is shockingly endearing and lovely :)</p>

<h4>I Don’t Really Mind</h4>

<p>woah… I didn’t know how this LP would possibly close out (especially after the last track) but a slightly more minimal, pop-oriented track is somehow really fitting</p>

<p>BUT OUCH my ears with that synth in the middle, wth :c</p>

<p>…it sounds kinda cool tho</p>

<p>thinking about it though- that’s a really aggressive, perfectly expected way to provide a visceral ending to all of this as an experience :)</p>
