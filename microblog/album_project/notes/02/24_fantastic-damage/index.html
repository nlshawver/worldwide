<h2>notes for february 24</h2>

<h1>Fantastic Damage by El-P</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Fantastic Damage</h4>

<p>jesus, I don’t even know how to start describing this- I thought the fact that the intro felt so much like an outro was an interesting, compelling sort of touch, but the actual beat and vocals just felt out of pace, dragged a bit by the necessity of it</p>

<p>I don’t know how to describe it, especially cause I thought the lyrics were relatively interesting… it just felt off :/</p>

<h4>Squeegee Man Shooting</h4>

<p>the first verse here is much better in my opinion, and it feels more confident in its delivery… but the layered vocals in the chorus just kind of separate me from the track as a whole</p>

<p>the weird, sort of creeping beat behind it is very nice though ^</p>

<p>I think it might just be the chorus for me; the verses have a swagger to them in their detail, the chorus is just less than great for me unfortunately</p>

<p>mr squeegee :O</p>

<h4>Deep Space 9mm</h4>

<p>that poof got me :)</p>

<p>I like this a lot more; the bars feel more potent and defined, and it all meshes so much better together as a cohesive piece</p>

<p>I think the second verse is the best part of these first three tracks for sure, it’s really appealing and has that undefinable quality that just makes your ears perk up :D</p>

<p>that super-washed out ride cymbal is nice too ^^</p>

<p>right here holding my nuts</p>

<h4>Tuned Mass Damper</h4>

<p>the last bar of this incredibly detailed, extended verse is sort of anticlimactic for me, but the build-up with the constant step up in quality with each bar is really damn good :O</p>

<p>okay the second verse coming in is the crescendo, damn… :D</p>

<h4>Dead Disnee</h4>

<p>oh my god this sample haha (:</p>

<p>jesus christ this just keeps getting more and more chaotic and manic… the bars go from huge multisyllabic pieces into dragging, wavey messes that somehow still hit in a very calculated way</p>

<p>that’s jaw-dropping; this second verse is hugely impressive :O</p>

<h4>Delorean</h4>

<p>have to give a shout-out to these incredibly well-placed transitions ^^</p>

<p>Aesop’s inclusion is a very good choice- the similar but unique motifs that come with each of their styles is a nice pairing, no doubt</p>

<p>that hook that El-P does after the short instrumental, along with the second hook with Aes and the El-P verse… that’s another great moment on this record, even if it takes a lot out of you to focus and listen to the detail of it all</p>

<h4>Truancy</h4>

<p>to be honest, while a lot of this record feels like a sort of genuine, curated experience, this is already a bit tinged with melancholic apprehension on my part… despite the incredible skill shown off so far</p>

<p>I really love that instrumental outro, but it’s taking a lot to stay consistently interested in such a raspy, abrading style ^^</p>

<h4>The Nang, the Front, the Bush and the Shit</h4>

<p>another incredibly punchy, raucous instrumental with wonderful lyrics; I can’t say anything negative about this track :O</p>

<p>but that might be the problem, it’s so hard to keep track of that I can’t form any sort of thoughts about it- I can tell the clear skill shown off, but it just doesn’t feel super memorable outside of the confines and context of the LP I don’t think</p>

<p>I will say this is one of my favorite tracks in this first half though, for sure ^^</p>

<h4>Accidents Don’t Happen</h4>

<p>these transitions are insane, wth; and great record scratches in front of this beat :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll take a hostage and walk through the mosh pit<br/>Pristine untouched, NB703&#39;s unscuffed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>jesus christ, that bar is astounding even in the midst of an incredible verse; the delivery and detail in it is seriously impressive ^^</p>

<p>I don’t have much else to say honestly, that was just overall good</p>

<h4>Stepfather Factory</h4>

<p>great start lol- damn okay this is the most compelling instrumental for me, shiiit :D</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In your mommy can be rooted out, burned, scorned, turned out, forgotten<br/>So you can concentrate on candy and little baby dolls or<br/>Whatever it is that normal kids get to think about</p>
</blockquote>

<p>THE FACT he <strong>somehow</strong> rhymes “turned out, forgotten” with “-tle baby dolls or” is absolutely insane… genuinely what the hell</p>

<p>he’s just showing of- this is my favorite track for sure :D</p>

<p>oh yea and the meaning of the track is really good too, but I didn’t realize that until halfway through if I’m being completely honest</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember, no cash returns<br/>Only credits towards future purchases</p>
</blockquote>

<p>damn…</p>

<h4>T.O.J.</h4>

<p>I’d say this is a pretty good follow-up- it’s not as dense as the last track I don’t think, but the detail comes through really well in the chorus</p>

<p>and damn that instrumental change that comes in before the two minute mark… that’s a huge style point ^^</p>

<h4>Dr. Hellno and the Praying Mantus</h4>

<p>mmm I don’t know- I think the interweaving of rhythm with the bars here, while technically proficient it seems, is also just not as focused as I think it should feel</p>

<p>I think when El-P comes in again he has a more cohesive, fitting sort of flow over the beat, but it’s still just a bit of a turn-off for me :(</p>

<p>I think the mid-section of that second verse is really good, and when Vast Aire comes back in for the third verse he sounds much better to my ears, but my mind’s been set since the repetition of this instrumental unfortunately ^</p>

<h4>Lazerfaces’ Warning</h4>

<p>this is a really good instrumental, and the lyrics and flow before and around the midsection are impressive as the rest of this LP… but I’m just so burnt out from this LP</p>

<p>and the ending does not help that feeling for me</p>

<h4>Innocent Leader</h4>

<p>my only wish was that El-P rapped over this beat ;c</p>

<p>that synth line at the middle is SO DAMN GOOD :O</p>

<h4>Constellation Funk</h4>

<p>somehow I think this track sort of regains a bit of my love for this style; it’s another more refined piece, and I think a lot of the bars fit excellently through here :)</p>

<p>I think it might also be because that instrumental gave me a bit more appreciation for the actual skill here… but it doesn’t make up for the first impression syndrome against the LP as a whole :/</p>

<h4>Blood</h4>

<p>yea I’m just kinda checked out right now- any great qualities that El-P has shown throughout this record are just meaningless at this point</p>

<p>seventy minutes is much too long with the same sort of similar styles throughout the whole LP; it’s great, but it’s a lot of the same, and the ending doesn’t close nearly as good as it should for an album of its stature :(</p>
