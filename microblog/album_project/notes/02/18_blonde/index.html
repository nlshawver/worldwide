<h2>notes for february 18</h2>

<h1>Blonde by Frank Ocean</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Nikes</h4>

<p>this is such an interesting, weird sort of start- I think the pitched vocals are both its strength and weakness, so the track is really only good as an opener to me so far… that instrumental is absolutely lovely tho :O</p>

<p>and when his vocals actually pop in and give a completely different second half and ending to the track… it completes this track in such a nice, compelling, and ear-catching sort of way :)</p>

<p>especially when he harmonizes with himself, oh my god ^</p>

<p>overall just a very, very solid introductory piece to get this LP going</p>

<h4>Ivy</h4>

<p>with the slight, sort of pulsating guitar and bass lines here, this is another really, really good downtempo track- especially as a sort of continuation of the aesthetic from Nikes :)</p>

<p>it sounds absolutely wonderful, and Ocean’s vocals are stunningly well fitting, especially towards the second half :D</p>

<p>somehow those little yelps at the very tail end—while incredibly jarring and off-putting—completely match on an emotional level to what’s happening</p>

<h4>Pink + White</h4>

<p>and god damn… this track :O</p>

<p>this is definitely the more uptempo arch that stems out of the last track, and jesus if it doesn’t feel absolutely fantastic; the little beat breaks, interjected and meshed in-between with by Ocean’s vocal lines (along with the careful instrumental) are such a transcendent combination</p>

<p>best track of the first third, I love this so mf much</p>

<h4>Be Yourself</h4>

<p>honestly a sobering (please forgive this shitty pun I just realized) sort of interlude… it just feels backhanded while having that mask of love</p>

<h4>Solo</h4>

<p>and damn what a turn around, this is a perfect sort of vacuum that came out from the interlude; great way to transition out of it with this aching sort of instrumental, with even more incredible vocals, as is usual</p>

<p>Ocean’s vocals on this record definitely feel a bit more refined and in control than on channel ORANGE, which I think breeds a different sort of energy to both of them (and it compliments both, of course)</p>

<p>I really really like this track; some of the lyrics are absolutely ridiculous, but it’s so personable and introspective, I love it :D</p>

<p>that little resolved chord at the end is amazing, thank u so much</p>

<h4>Skyline To</h4>

<p>I like the sort of conversational, playful lyrics that start off this track :)</p>

<p>there’s two styles that Ocean sort of waves through on this LP, and this track (along with the first two on the record) have that sort of aesthetic that gives them a very casual, laidback intonation that I think adds a good amount to the progression of the album as a whole ^</p>

<p>especially when the whole track leads up to a tiny crescendo of harmony, and that’s it</p>

<h4>Self Control</h4>

<p>ooh that guitar is a really nice instrumental change :O</p>

<p>not the absolute biggest fan of that small verse from Austin Feinstein, but the contrast between the two of their vocal styles is a nice touch- this is definitely not a skip with how this track develops :)</p>

<p>OH MY GOD his vocals without that shift feels like chains being removed; it’s like a completely different feel, and I love it :D</p>

<p>that was definitely one of the little peaks on the record, I loved that a lot more than I was expecting/remembering</p>

<h4>Good Guy</h4>

<p>another short, nice interlude; not much else to see, just lo-fi vocals :)</p>

<p>he don’t got bitches no more</p>

<h4>Nights</h4>

<p>ROUND YOUR CITY ROUND THE CLOCK</p>

<p>god this track is one of my favorite songs of all time, bar very few others</p>

<p>every single part of it feels meticulous, personal, and most importantly: earned. it’s a moment that feels absolutely perfect for the record, perfect with each little instrumental piece of the track, perfect over both halves of it</p>

<p>it’s just so beautiful to me, there’s not much else to say; it’s a personal connection that doesn’t merit itself well to written word</p>

<h4>Solo (Reprise)</h4>

<p>ooooh more andré :D</p>

<p>jesus christ what a shift from the last track; the actual rapping is such a great moment too, I love it ^</p>

<h4>Pretty Sweet</h4>

<p>holy shit that start is insane :O</p>

<p>the little sound bytes, vocal harmony behind the primary melody, and the guitar riff throughout this whole thing are such an incredible departure from the styling of the first half… and I love it ^^</p>

<p><em>especially</em> with that explosive drum beat that comes in :D</p>

<h4>Facebook Story</h4>

<p>thank u sebastian</p>

<p>that’s honestly a really good break in terms of theme with the emotive nature of this whole LP ^</p>

<h4>Close to You</h4>

<p>this feels like another interlude like the last track too, but with more structure comes a bit more significance; it feels completely different, and it transitions very well into:</p>

<h4>White Ferrari</h4>

<p>I don’t think I could come up with a better idea for this track’s placement in the arch of this second act; it fits so snugly into all of this, and the acoustic nature of pretty much all of it makes it so damn personable and touching</p>

<p>and yes, the vocals are yet again great (I don’t think I need to say that any longer tbh)</p>

<p>mini drum beat :D</p>

<h4>Seigfried</h4>

<p>every little instrumental piece on this feels so great in the thick of all of it- but in this case that warped and pitched guitar, which then leads into this bass line... it feels particularly touching with everything else here</p>

<p>god and the messaging that comes with Ocean&#39;s lyrics when he gets more washed or blown out throughout the track–while chaotic and sometimes nonsensical–add a very needed emotional connection in this track :)</p>

<h4>Godspeed</h4>

<p>you! black emperor</p>

<p>jesus christ the vocals here are especially impressive and emotive; this track is absolutely perfect for the tail end of this LP, I love it</p>

<h4>Futura Free</h4>

<p>this sort of piano freestyle kind of start is honestly–while chaotic in nature–feels like a great way to start the end off (rip pac)</p>

<p>and that instrumental shift with the occasional spikes with the triangle– damn :D</p>

<p>and then that main ending just cuts, and it&#39;s all over with that...</p>

<p>to be honest, even though it&#39;s a confusing, slightly meaningless piece to close out on, the fact that it&#39;s so close-up, so personal, and so genuine...</p>

<p>that&#39;s the best way to wrap up the ending, package this up, and give a little send-off :)</p>

<p>how far <em>is</em> a light year tho?</p>
