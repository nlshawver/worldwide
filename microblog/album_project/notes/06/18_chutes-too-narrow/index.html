<h1>mini notes for chutes too narrow</h1>

<ul>
	<li>wow, I was not expecting kissing the lipless at all as an opener; what a shockingly detailed, instrumentally dense cut about a flawed relationship and past/present memories :o

		<ul>
			<li>the chimes closing it out are beautiful :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I’m honestly even more impressed by mine’s not a high horse; it’s maybe not as dense instrumentally but the theme shines through brightly and cohesively, being about the overt and obvious struggles of a band on the rise

		<ul>
			<li>the final line of “one finger parallel to the sky” is perfect :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy… so says I is perfect, with the cutting takes of capitalism and communism very well shrouded, up until the end, indicting humanity as a whole :ooo

		<ul>
			<li>god the vocals and instrumentals, while mixing harshly, come together wonderfully for an early peak in this tracklist :DD</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>young pilgrims is a kind of brutal continuation, more directly talking of a seasonal type of depression… I think it might be a bit jarring on its own, feeling so different from the previous track, but it’s still damn good</li>
	<li>saint simon is another jarring experience, but in the complete opposite direction- it focuses on never knowing some things, and having to find solace in love in order to stay sane and grounded (despite not knowing what one so desperately would want to)

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a bit graceful and haunting simultaneously; it’s just a wild experience to have in the middle of this already dense tracklist :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>fighting in a sack is another cut that does a good amount with what it has; I really like and appreciate the theme presented of questioning life, absurdism, and the qualms of religion… but the instrumental combinations and weaving have wavered a bit thin for me somehow…</li>
	<li>pink bullets retains a bit of the value though, the love story of a couple separating does not make the instrumental feel wasted at all; it’s a worthwhile moment that feels genuinely contemplative</li>
	<li>which—god, makes the next song so grossly overbearing to my ears :c

		<ul>
			<li>cause the song’s about desires overpowering love and feeling like just a creature of desire… BUT THAT’S AFTER YOU JUST HAD A SONG ABOUT BREAKING UP WITH SOMEONE AND LEAVING THEM BEHIND DUDE</li>
			<li>i don’t get it, enlighten me pleas— oh it’s over</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>gone for good is pretty good, but I’m just still taken aback, and its themes still feel very split atm &gt;.&lt;</li>
	<li>okay I think I’ve recovered- those to come feels like a very ethereal, experimental conclusion that suits this sort of record well imo; it’s not as dense lyrically as a few others here, but it serves its mushroom theme very well, and leaves on a good note imo :)</li>
</ul>
