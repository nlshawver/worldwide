<h1>mini notes for q: are we not men? a: we are devo!</h1>

<ul>
	<li>while I wasn’t entirely blown away by it, uncontrollable urge is a pretty good opener for this little debut new wave album :)</li>
	<li>and while the rolling stones version is obviously ‘better’ in every way, I do like reworking (i can’t get no) satisfaction from a teenage angst anthem into a denunciation of commercialism; it’s a good rework even if it’s a jarring split :o</li>
	<li>praying hands is an interesting little take; I definitely appreciate the themes its bringing up, about societal expectations and pressures, parental advising, and a bit more… but I don’t connect very deeply past that point I think</li>
	<li>somehow space junk is the strangest song present here so far :o

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a bit jarring almost, which can make it at times pretty appealing… only occasionally, but still</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>mongoloid?

		<ul>
			<li>I do like the fact that, even if the topic at hand of this song is a bit harsh, it tackles it more-so as an indictment of the society this person lives in, and treats (as much as possible I guess) the subject as a kind of hero able to ‘fit in,’ despite the clear negativity shown towards a conformist society on this record</li>
			<li>it is a bit awkward though, and isn’t a high point on the record I don’t think :/</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow okay, was not expecting jocko homo at all… it’s such a weird experience that I don’t even know how to describe

		<ul>
			<li>but I don’t think it was a standout either; each track in this early midsection feels like it could lead to something new or interesting… it just doesn’t</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>too much paranoias was an honestly great track though, the more excitable and metaphorical big mac attack was weird and stupid, but also charming for a record like this :)

		<ul>
			<li>it’s probably the best blatant consumerist indictment in the tracklist so far (for me at least, since the first two tracks are more-so focused on the people in the society)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>gut feeling was a good follow-up too, with a great stretch of an instrumental intro, into another wild experience of sound collaging from brian eno and david bowie, and some just-as-strange lyrics from the band members(?)

		<ul>
			<li>and it going right into come back jonee is a great little duo on the backend; it might only interest me to a close level to the starting few tracks, but it’s still a pretty good lead-up to the closer(s) :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>sloppy is totally not about sex, and definitely just about a french fry missing the middle of a donut… there’s no symbolism in that music video at all, I promise you

		<ul>
			<li>this was a pretty alright track though, nothing too stellar—the vocals stand out in a good way though, riding well above a well-constructed instrumental</li>
			<li>it just blends in a bit I think ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my god shrivel-up is such a unique, insane experience even for this already wild album… I won’t say it saves any of my feelings towards this record atm, but the way it completely destroys their established sound, while still closing out their record with an extension of the themes they built it on… it’s a fantastic closer, and I’ll leave it at that :)</li>
</ul>
