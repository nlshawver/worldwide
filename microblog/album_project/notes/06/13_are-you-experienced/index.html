<h1>mini notes for are you experienced</h1>

<ul>
	<li>oh my god the three track run (on the NA version) of purple haze, manic depression, and hey joe is so incredibly well done; while I think I definitely prefer the barreling riff of purple haze more, the emotion drawn from the following cuts is wonderful :D</li>
	<li>I’ll be honest, while love or confusion is a pretty good continuation, may this be love was a bit of an off-point; I didn’t really fully connect with its slower, more deliberately downtempo aesthetic about it, and it didn’t connect with me nearly as greatly as the cuts prior ^</li>
	<li>and while i don’t live today and fire had a similar energy level to the openers, only fire offers a significantly fantastic experience to my ears; the wind cries mary was a better downtempo experience I think, but I’m just still a bit thrown for a loop to be honest</li>
	<li>but damnn third stone from the sun to foxey lady to are you experienced is such a run for the end of the record; I hadn’t previously heard the first of those tracks, but it’s such a jazz-infused journey of intrigue, and one that leads functionally perfectly into foxey lady :DD</li>
	<li>a confusing closer, but a great one nonetheless; its sense of awe is never lost c:</li>
