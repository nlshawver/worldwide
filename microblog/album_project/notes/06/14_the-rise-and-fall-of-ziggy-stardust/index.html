<h1>mini notes for the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars</h1>

<ul>
	<li>no way the album cover says kanye west no fucking way :O</li>
	<li>anyways—I’ll need a bit of a revisit for the opening two tracks, and it took me a second to really appreciate the strained vocals on starman again… but my god it’s such a beautiful moment only four tracks in

		<ul>
			<li>seriously, that collection of songs that led up to the final explosion of character in bowie’s singing, in the final minute of starman… in the context of this experience it is a wondrous, off-kilter, beautifully arranged composition :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>it ain’t easy might have been a weird moment that took effort to understand, but damn that hook on lady stardust :O</li>
	<li>star is one beautiful sort of continuation from lady stardust; it may almost feel slightly hollow, less underlying meaning and subtle movements in its emotions (being a very blown up rockist cut), but it’s still pretty damn great :)</li>
	<li>was not expecting hang on to yourself :o

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a very useful, jarring twist from the half-mainstream rock sensibilities of star into an infectiously wound instrumental and the perfect sort of inflection on bowie’s singing voice :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ziggy stardust is a wonderful tale wrapped into a bow of instrumental bliss that bowie already perfected up to this point; it might not be any sort of peak, but it’s vital to this record :o</li>
	<li>and suffragette city and rock &amp; roll suicide are both wildly meaningful tracks—one a compounding, spanning rock cut, and the other a stripped back, acoustic (at first) ballad to span an emotive flourish, ending the record just as perfectly as it started c:

		<ul>
			<li>like come on- those explosive vocals from bowie are so fucking powerful, so wild, so meaningful… there’s no way to describe that intense, driving feeling it caps off on, GOD DAMN :OO</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
