<h1>mini notes for american dream</h1>

<ul>
	<li>fantastic synth opener, it feels equally confident and uneasy with the chords the deep, crackling synth matches up with :o

		<ul>
			<li>&quot;we move like a bad scene shot in the dark&quot; is a perfect feeling end to that verse b4 the chorus :D</li>
			<li>the chorus just feels absolutely perfect with the buildup the verses provide, and the way it perfectly matches the nostalgia value in a heavy breakup track :O</li>
			<li>god that bridge is another great moment, damn ^</li>
			<li>what a mf song, fantastic opener :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that bass line to start other voices &gt;&gt;

		<ul>
			<li>honestly, while the lyrics can verge on too vague or borderline nonsensical, there&#39;s a good amount of merit in the energy and creative span it measures; the hook might be the one lacking thing to my ears though, it&#39;s just a bit fractured compared to the rest ^</li>
			<li>still a compelling instrumental, it almost feels a bit desert-themed at some point in the first half</li>
			<li>nancy whang&#39;s contribution opened up the track a little to my ears, definitely an essential part of this track :o</li>
			<li>outro vocals don&#39;t carry enough weight in my ears tho, but the way the instrumental closes seems to fit well (with the proposed theme of incompatible beliefs and the inability to change)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>hell yea that bass :DD

		<ul>
			<li>i used to starts off beautifully, everything starts off meshing wonderfully to the ears c:</li>
			<li>the nod to bowie ties in well with the striking guitar piece that comes through in a shockingly well-made part of the track, and overall it&#39;s just a pretty good cut</li>
			<li>I can&#39;t help but feel I&#39;m not really getting the full appeal of the record so far, but I give it time ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yea, the vocal passages of change yr mind fit in with this chaotic, sprawling instrumental, but there&#39;s not a ton of collective worth to the words (to me at least)

		<ul>
			<li>like of course the heartfelt meaning of the track is not lost, but it&#39;s becoming a chore to connect perfectly with the meaning conveyed</li>
			<li>the repeated line in the outro drives things home well though, I liked that and appreciate its merit very well :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that sting at the start of how do you sleep tho :OO

		<ul>
			<li>I do like the connection to a former acquaintance gone horribly wrong, but I&#39;m glad the track is as long as it is- it needs that added meaning to stretch and grow in my mind to appreciate its sound</li>
			<li>that HUGE SYNTH is absolutely driving as hell, what an explosion of emotion :OO</li>
			<li>see that&#39;s what I mean, that&#39;s incredible :D</li>
			<li>GOD DAMN the way this track grows is infectious as all hell :oooo</li>
			<li>it&#39;s literally perfect in the way it develops and shifts each narrative piece of the jaded, sinking vocals</li>
			<li>this is a hateful version of dance yrself clean lol</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>dance punk classic with tonite&#39;s start; that instrumental is just instantly an earworm

		<ul>
			<li>whether that&#39;s going to sustain itself well is a question I will soon find out the answer to</li>
			<li>that string-reminiscent synth sting that grows the beat is something that succeeds really well in keeping the energy here; the topic at hand of the vocals decays a bit behind it by the halfway point though if I&#39;m being honest with myself ^</li>
			<li>okay murphy saves it really well with the lyrical content that comes at the second half, it hints rather obviously towards everything he&#39;s attempting to prod</li>
			<li>yea the ending there is really good; it turns a bit of a mess into something very redeeming :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>call the police is another track that I think has a lot of merit in its artistic ventures, lyrically and substantively- but it wears its influence plainly (not a bad thing necessarily), and the uniqueness of it in the tracklist wears thin to me quite quickly 

		<ul>
			<li>this is becoming one of those records that I would never skip a track, but outside of the starting cut and how do you sleep, I wouldn&#39;t be incredible committed to listening</li>
			<li>it&#39;s a great record that I don&#39;t have a ton of interest in revisiting much as a cohesive unit, much like funeral</li>
			<li>but in this case I&#39;m connecting a lot less to each individual track on a consistent basis I guess ;(</li>
			<li>good instrumental ending tho c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow okay, the title track here surprised me with how instantly it changes footing :O

		<ul>
			<li>that is a hauntingly beautiful sting at the line &quot;but that&#39;s okay&quot; I have to admit :D</li>
			<li>this might be the track with the greatest meaning to me, since it discusses so openly aging of a generation, a person after their life choices are falling into place, and so much more in an unspoken sense, up to my own interpretation</li>
			<li>american dream definitely has the most interesting lyrical content, and the instrumental doesn&#39;t fit weakly at all so far, especially with the interesting cadence of the synth bass :)</li>
			<li>yea those chords are beautiful, god damn :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn okay, the repetitions and the way emotional haircut comes into itself feels like a weird departure from what made the title track so great; it&#39;s not a bad experience, just one that doesn&#39;t fit well here to my ears at all :c</li>
	<li>the hard interrupt line is the best vocal moment of black screen so far; the time given to carefully build this eulogy and final, artistic words given to one of murphy&#39;s idols and mentors is admirable at a minimum

		<ul>
			<li>regardless of the rest of how I think about this album as a unit, I will never be disrespectful towards such a touching message</li>
			<li>it&#39;s a really beautiful collective experience to close on, even if the cause of such a track is so ugly and depressing in nature...</li>
			<li>the space the instrumental gets to breathe is both 100% useful and haunting in why it needs that spaceâ€”it&#39;s a hugely meaningful track, and I love it for that</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
