<h1>mini notes for to be kind</h1>

<ul>
	<li>okay I did not realize that this was a two hour epic- so unfortunately these notes might be sparse for the content of the record, even if I’ll add in what I consider important</li>
	<li>that chugging bass riff and really stripped down first verse, with the sinister vocal timbre is a really fantastic combo; that deep synth that comes in too :O

		<ul>
			<li>holy shit though, when the instrumental finally decides to explode with the harsh shredding and shrill aesthetic of that instrumental overload it is absolutely, ridiculously intense :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>even though I’ve had ten minutes to think it though and realize the type of track that just a little boy is- I’m still speechless, I still have no words for what is going on

		<ul>
			<li>those guitar stings are incredibly punchy amidst such sparse instrumentations, and truly disconcerting proclamations from gira :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>bladee wrote some of the lyrics for a little god in my hands? what the actual fuck, that’s such a weird combination lol

		<ul>
			<li>oh but yea this is song is absolutely insane; those terrifying synths grasp at your ears like claws—I don’t know how better to explain it, that’s just what it sounds like, and with the previous lyrical content it’s just so damn off-putting yet intriguing at the same time :o</li>
			<li>it has been half an hour and I’m not even a fourth of the way done</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>this song is longer than the entirety of some albums I’ve listened to this year lol

		<ul>
			<li>this thing starts incredible well though my god- that riff is bombastic just for the sake of it, and it sounds like an instrumental freight train incapable of giving a shit to ever possibly stop. I mean it does, but it takes the duration of an entire song to get there-</li>
			<li>god bring the sun feels like the climax to an absolutely haunting epiphany in a destructive tale of epic proportions; the god/ra parallels are what delivers it to that incredible peak of transcendent dysphoria :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>jesus fucking christ the sting to start off toussaint l’ouverture is insane after the previous venture…

		<ul>
			<li>the instrumental before the slowed-down dip before the verse is indescribable; it sets the stage perfectly :o</li>
			<li>but so long as you’re paying enough attention, not letting your mind wander, the eight minute intro prior to the verse goes by without a hitch, not feeling nearly that long- it’s detailed enough to sustain continued interest, which is impressive as all hell, cause it’s already been an hour ^</li>
			<li>what a mf closer too; it’s such a triumphant, painful finish to such a monumental song :O</li>
			<li>I legitimately have no other words, there’s no way to encapsulate that track and its whole ethos with nothing but words</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>incredible callback to screen shot w this track; I also love the parallels that while these are all essential human experiences, it can make us feel equally praised and small, hearing it all laid out so plainly

		<ul>
			<li>it praises while almost being condescending, reminding us of how insignificant we can be…</li>
			<li>AND THAT’S JUST THE FIRST HALF OF THIS THING :OOOO</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god another intense, instantly recognizable and appealing riff to begin both she loves us and this second half of this colossus :D

		<ul>
			<li>the fact that this 17 minute long epic is about the trials and mental response to false love, false pretenses, and meaningless sex is such a wild, yet completely reasonable topic for a track— and the following esoteric, off-kilter track that stems from those feelings fits the mold to a tee :o</li>
			<li>literally the only moment that sonically feels disjointed is when the deep, rumbling drums continue for minutes on end- it’s a bit overbearing, but it still fits w the thematic journey of the track anyways…</li>
			<li>crushing ending to, what a mf closer to the second intro track :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god kirsten supine is an incredible track; it might be the most “single” worthy track on the record, feeling sublime in its unique energy despite what’s around it

		<ul>
			<li>the esoteric derivation of this track’s meaning is lovely too; referencing a movie from 2011, naming and basing the track off of the non-trivial, dark happenings of that is a great homage</li>
			<li>it’s a wonderful cut that underlines a lot of the high points of this album, and it’s truly great for that :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the abrupt shift into oxygen is jarring, but serves the track well in its purpose- it’s like a complete undoing of the tension of the previous track despite the heavy instrumentation

		<ul>
			<li>mainly because kirsten supine was such a lyrically significant, thematically huge moment, only for it to close right into a track describing an asthma attack :D</li>
			<li>it’s kinda genius honestly (amidst other genius), and I love it :)</li>
			<li>god damn that ending is one of the hardest-hitting moments on the entire record, my god :OOO</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the confident praise displayed on natalie neal is really endearing too; it doesn’t seem pandering, it almost seems god-like, like an over-exaggeration to properly display the level of appreciation and love one can have for someone they can connect so closely to…

		<ul>
			<li>another awe-inspiring track; the praise is wearing thin despite the lack of a drop in quality whatsoever :)</li>
			<li>“live forever in this song” damn…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and what a thematically and instrumentally immense closer; the theme of a child’s life, the innocence of life prior to adulthood, and the hope that may lie… that throbbing kick drum that barrels through the calm is such a fucking wake up call, and it’s just so towering over this entire piece :OOOOO

		<ul>
			<li>what a god damn album, what a mf track, and what an artistic crescendo… this is immaculately done</li>
			<li>still in awe, what an experience…:o</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
