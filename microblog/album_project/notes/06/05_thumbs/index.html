<h1>mini notes for thumbs</h1>

<ul>
	<li>great panning to start this mixtape, and a wild name of absolutions in the hottentot supercluster :)

		<ul>
			<li>honestly, while I didn’t really match well into the weird, off-kilter cadence of driver’s verses at the onset, the meaning of what he’s saying still seems to overshadow the flow- it takes a lot to get into the flow I think; it’s implicitly more complex and a bit more obtuse, just to get you to hear it all</li>
			<li>zeroh had a great ending verse though to be honest, he fits in with a bit of a different perspective I find very valuable in this opening cut :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yea that’s a really staggered, almost unorganized flow with the first verse on black labor— but god damn the way he shows he can fit right in with the beat is incredible :D

		<ul>
			<li>yea from the hook onwards its an insane instrumental with the bright, cheery synths (and slight bass) with busdriver’s sometimes intentionally accented inflection c:</li>
			<li>it’s not always fantastic, but the way he rides the beat in an intriguing, unique way is something I can’t overlook ^^</li>
			<li>and that’s ignoring the great lyrical content, the female sample at the end, and the crazed audio clip closing it out :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while I sort of like that driving, squealing synth lead in the background, I don’t see a lot in the lyrical content to back up such a beat on hyperbolic 2

		<ul>
			<li>not bad tho, just a bit of a downturn ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay woah, I really like that hook on much, but some of the way it comes together is just pretty good; I have to be honest tho in saying “with the creation myth, the bits between your ears ain&#39;t jailbroken” is a great dig at religion in the middle of some weirdly abstract bars in the first verse

		<ul>
			<li>and the quality stays high the whole song; it might’ve just been first listen jitters, this track is great :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>woah and I was not expecting the follow-up of ministry of the torture couch; it has a great little half-subtle instrumental under some pretty great, lush lyrical passages :)

		<ul>
			<li>I feel it’s not as significant as the previous or next tracks, but it’s certainly a fantastic way to bridge the gap between each :))</li>
			<li>that hook is really mf catchy too, I’ll always like the way busdriver sounds and the way he fits into stuff like this deep synth instrumental behind him :D</li>
			<li>jesus christ- I wasn’t all that huge about that second hook (even if I agree with it), but the way it ends up bookending an esoteric, beautiful third verse about downtrodden veterans, institutional racism and control, and government b.s. is actually really fucking great :OO</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay I don&#39;t know what it is, whether it&#39;s nostalgia or something similar, but I absolutely adore the instrumental and mixing of worlds to run- it&#39;s genuinely in my top fifty (maybe ten) songs ever made, it just connects so well w me :OOO

		<ul>
			<li>and even though it&#39;s a bit of a shift from the starting tracks prior, it&#39;s a wonderful moment for the tape :))</li>
			<li>everyone is incredible, milo&#39;s starting part is amazing, this was the first hook I ever heard from paak and it&#39;s stunning, and busdriver&#39;s part is the smoothest I&#39;ve ever heard him c:</li>
			<li>5/5, beautiful cut ^^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while I don&#39;t have much to say about the following cuts (it&#39;s a bit of a struggle to stay on things w vacation rn), but I think it was overall something that complimented the record</li>
	<li>genuinely this is a tape that merits more time to listen in detail, along with perfect hair (as this serves pretty much as a compliment/supplement/contrast to it); del’s feature is incredible, and each cut after worlds to run was at least intriguing :)</li>
	<li>great record, and think of the rating as a temporary mark of appreciation for both this and perfect hair c:</li>
</ul>
