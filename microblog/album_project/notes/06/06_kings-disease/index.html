<h1>mini notes for king&#39;s disease</h1>

<ul>
	<li>woah, great way to start the record with that title track; the hit-boy production is already pretty great, with that vocal sample provided some rly beautiful harmonics c:

		<ul>
			<li>the lyrical content is pretty damn good too, I especially liked the sprinkling in of black positivity with &quot;the stupidest part of africa produced blacks that started algebra&quot;, mixed all in with some equally intriguing poetry :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oooh great vocal sample into a powerful asf beat :O

		<ul>
			<li>damn this track with that minor beat switch and the shimmering yet effortlessly high-quality bars :))</li>
			<li>it&#39;s a bit of a simple track, but it&#39;s lovely in its own sense ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while the beat of car #85 isn&#39;t all too fantastical, the storytelling and thematic images seen in that first verse is a great moment on the record; it&#39;s a personal look yet again for nas on what seems to be some pretty personal life stories :o

		<ul>
			<li>it&#39;s a nice comedown from the previous track, to a certain extent at least</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ultra black as the lead single is such a good choice; that beat that just begs for the verse cadence to match gives a great sense of both careful confidence, along with just a wonderful voice to the whole cut :D

		<ul>
			<li>absolutely fantastic, almost inspiring track, just in the first foray into this record c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>alright alright, and 27 summers is a nice, short little banger to follow it up; it has a great starting verse and chorus, and that&#39;s about all it wrote :)</li>
	<li>replace me is just a bit of a weird mess after it though- the beat certainly isn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s just a bit of a turnaround from the previous tracks on the record, w both don toliver and big sean feeling weird as features here :/

		<ul>
			<li>don has a pretty alright hook, but big sean does not fit at all imo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh I know that instrumental on til the war is won :o

		<ul>
			<li>honestly it&#39;s a pretty passable track; there&#39;s just not a ton that shines through all that explicitly</li>
			<li>but it&#39;s a pleasant track about women in life, the honor held to them by nas, and that general positive energy; it&#39;s just not shockingly remarkable or anything like that</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>alright wow, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d like nas and paak together nearly as much as I do, but all bad is a pretty damn good ballad to come back from the previous track; there&#39;s a bit there to grab onto, and just enough for me to enjoy it pretty well :)</li>
	<li>damn, and while it&#39;s a short, almost forgettable track after all bad and its failed love themes, the definition is a nice little boom bap interlude c:</li>
	<li>full circle is definitely the mid-to-late album high point for me, especially with the surprisingly great az and cormega features; it&#39;s wonderfully indulgent, and overall made really damn well with more hit-boy mastery :))

		<ul>
			<li>and I didn&#39;t forget- foxy brown has a great feature as well, and serves as a nice aesthetic and thematic contrast with her own bars ^^</li>
			<li>dre outro? :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while it has just an okay transition into 10 points, damn the instrumental that comes through with the trumpets surrounding you and that deep bass... great follow-up track, if it&#39;s only just a bit indulgent :)

		<ul>
			<li>really glad there&#39;s three verses too, better space to spread his wings :O</li>
			<li>this and full circle are a hell of a duo ngl :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay goddamn the cure might be the most detailed, interesting, and almost soulful cut here so far :OO

		<ul>
			<li>the mccartney/lennon line to start, comparing him and pac/biggie/etc. respectively is a fantastic way to follow a paradox of the industry and common perception</li>
			<li>and then it&#39;s just constant bars of intrigue and life lessons and experiences :o</li>
			<li>the MOMA line on the second verse, along w generational curses, mc shan and marley marl, and the mf rick james behavior lines are all highlights ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>&quot;mets hat in the sky like bobby shmurda&quot; damn lmao

		<ul>
			<li>honestly this is not the best outro track, but on its own it&#39;s another indulgent track w some not bad features w this beat ^</li>
			<li>yea fivio is just pretty good, but ferg shines on this beat (rather obviously too)</li>
			<li>I think this could&#39;ve been served better in a different part of the tracklist, especially since ferg technically closes out the album, but whatever- it&#39;s still one of the better tracks I think</li>
		</ul></li>
