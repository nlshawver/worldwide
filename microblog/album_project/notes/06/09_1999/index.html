<h1>mini notes for 1999</h1>

<ul>
	<li>infectious little intro track with summer knights, sets the scene for the record very well imo :)</li>
	<li>damnn, perfect beat for waves :oo

		<ul>
			<li>genuinely personable and interesting lyrical content to lay over such an instrumental, beautiful track :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oooh that beat switch and the bars and tape skips that follow on fromdatomb$ are all incredible to the ears :O

		<ul>
			<li>chuck strangers has a great little feature in the mid-section as well; pleasantly surprised joey comes back w the third verse c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I thought survival tactics was a good continuation, but when the beat drops out, and only comes back after that gunshot drowning everything out... damn what a track to come with so early here :OO

		<ul>
			<li>doing it again isn&#39;t nearly as powerful I think, but having it for both joey and steez&#39;s verse feels valuable ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>keeping capital steez on for the following track I think is perfect, it feels like a great sequel track to the previous cut, and caps it off well before track six :)

		<ul>
			<li>killuminati is honestly a rly great moment on the record, and it transitions well into the slightly more downtempo aesthetic of hardknock</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>which in itself is a emotive, and yet again personal cut that feels perfect for this time on the mixtape :o

		<ul>
			<li>oh my god, both joey and cj fly have amazing lyrical passages, but especially bada$$ on the midsection to end; it&#39;s so detailed, so smoothly delivered and conceptualized</li>
			<li>might be one of my favorite moments so far, even though it&#39;s all consistently great :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit and the first verse of world domination :OOO

		<ul>
			<li>god damn that&#39;s perfect, what a follow-up; it&#39;s another peak of the record, and back-to-back at that :DD</li>
			<li>this is staggeringly great :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>pennyroyal is a nice follow-up, but it amounts to much less weight than the previous two cuts- even if it&#39;s still an infectious experience, just like funky ho&#39;s, which comes just after again ^</li>
	<li>daily routine recaptures that personal experience, feeling like a great amalgamation of everything put together, that just makes the life led difficult and stressful as all hell :o</li>
	<li>and same thing goes with snakes, it feels like such a powerful experience to have right after daily routine gives a bit of an introduction into the detailed and moving verses from joey (and a great hook from t&#39;nah apex :)</li>
	<li>while I&#39;m not crazy about don&#39;t front, the instrumental is still pretty damn good, and the slight self-realizations and contradictions on the later verses keep the whole thing interestingly well done ^</li>
	<li>righteous minds might be the most meaningful cut on the latter half of the tape, showing his own signs of growth, while still being trapped in the cycle of death and decay surrounding him</li>
	<li>where it&#39;$ at is a pretty good follow-up as well, but it just didn&#39;t shine nearly as well (on first listen) as a few other more significant cuts</li>
	<li>I&#39;m mainly hoping this ending posse cut lives up to its runtime ^^

		<ul>
			<li>I&#39;ll be honest in saying I won&#39;t be able to recognize each voice though; this is my first time listening to a full joey bada$$ project, and so the voices can blend in with themselves on first listen (as with many other first experiences)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>but damn- so far each feature (and joey himself) have a good amount of chemistry together and a charming hook, which altogether amounts to a fantastic closer that just keeps delivering :D</li>
</ul>
