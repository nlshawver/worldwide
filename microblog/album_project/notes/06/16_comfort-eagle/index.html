<h1>mini notes for comfort eagle</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I was not expecting opera singer to be… this literal—but I guess I forgot the type of band that cake is ;)</li>
	<li>meanwhile rick james is honestly a really compelling track; it’s a bit of a purposefully weird, esoteric story that works really well with the instrumental ^

		<ul>
			<li>I like it :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>shadow stabbing is honestly a bit of a calming track, despite “the frenzied pace of the mind inside the cell” being terrifying; good stuff, right before…</li>
	<li>short skirt/long jacket is such a classic :D

		<ul>
			<li>everything to it, from that incessant bass riff, the very direct and honest lyrics, and the early 2000’s aesthetic that’s all over this thing (and the rest of the record of course)</li>
			<li>it’s just so damn good :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>commissioning a symphony in c is honestly almost heartfelt; the really specific premise is jarring to get into, but the final two stanzas tie things into a really disjointed and existential conclusion: “you are seldom breathing life, but mostly death”</li>
	<li>arco arena is a really useful instrumental track, and it’s another really great instrumental from cake :)</li>
	<li>especially going into the title track :O

		<ul>
			<li>god that bass line is insane…:o</li>
			<li>“you can dress up like a sultan in your onion head hat” bruh lol</li>
			<li>honestly it might be one of my favorite cuts from the midsection to far; the tight political commentary with the coke and pepsi line is really well-made, and it’s just a great mf instrumental :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>but holy shit, long line of cars is such an introspectively depressing track; it coats societal problems and human reactions to trauma and disaster under the pretenses of traffic

		<ul>
			<li>what a great set-up; it uncovers itself a bit more with the “sin” line, but it holds the line really well</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I get the point of love you madly, but with the fact that I didn’t as directly connect with the previous and this track’s instrumentals, it just sort of floated past my ears unfortunately :/</li>
	<li>but thankfully both pretty pink ribbon and world of two come through with a bit of a downtempo, perfectly casual (yet meaningful) cuts to come right after

		<ul>
			<li>they’re not super incredible or ground-breaking at all, but they have a subtly happy and overall positive inflection that makes them a very pleasant ending pair :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
