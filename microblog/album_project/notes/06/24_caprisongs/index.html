<h1>mini notes for caprisongs</h1>

<ul>
	<li>woah, that chorus was so subtly wild on ride the dragon- I really like the way the whole track is pretty much a chopped and screwed song about… well that’s kinda obvious from the lyrics

		<ul>
			<li>it’s just stylish and really appealing in a perfectly unique way :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh, this is another one I love- the intro from pa salieu and the way both twigs and him work around the track and the subtle instrumental is just effortlessly appealing :D

		<ul>
			<li>their voices match and contrast each other really well, and I love the wordplay :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>meta angel feels like a bit of a deconstruction, from the spoken intro, to the very minimal instrumentation, chorus discussing holding yourself back, and an attempt to destroy that part of yourself :o

		<ul>
			<li>it might not be the densest, easiest to listen to track, but it’s incredibly valuable to the development of sound and emotion for sure ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that dancefloor beat right after :o

		<ul>
			<li>tears in the club would, I think, otherwise feel like a betrayal of the emotion seen in meta angel- but the fact that w the weeknd it’s so obviously a façade over the lyrical content is what makes it still appealing, interesting, and fit in well in this tape :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my love is definitely a sort of part two for tears in the club, having a similar kind of sound and emotion- and while that final post-chorus felt amazing with a bit of a peak in energy, it might be the least standout of the tracklist so far to me ^</li>
	<li>pamplemousse is a nice little, eclectic track that follows well thematically w the end of oh my love- and while it doesn’t peak at all, that slight unease at the sounds molded under twigs’s vocals are pretty interesting ^</li>
	<li>interlude moment

		<ul>
			<li>dog :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly lightbeamers—while a bit of an ethereal mix in the tracklist—doesn’t hold a whole lot of weight overall despite the lyrical content

		<ul>
			<li>that outro and the final chorus were pretty good together tho, I have to be honest ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the instrumental of papi bones can feel expressive and a bit catchy at times (especially right before the end tbh), but it just didn’t really connect w me that much in this whole experience</li>
	<li>honestly, while it’s a short, half-interlude track, which way was a pleasant, expressive, and interesting experience :)

		<ul>
			<li>the esoteric feel of it and the playful main section was the part that really got me to like it- which just makes the short runtime sting a bit (but I’m not complaining, since it was there anyways)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>jealousy feels similar to papi bones- it’s not bad, and the emotion behind the vocals and the general inflection is not missing… it just went in and out of my ears without the same impact as some of the earlier tracks here ^</li>
	<li>ooh wow, was not expecting that kind of chorus and deep bass on careless :o

		<ul>
			<li>and daniel caesar is such a nice addition with his verse and vocal/lyrical contrast :D</li>
			<li>yea the feeling and generally heightened sense of meaning of this track makes it a bit of a return for me; it’s such a lovely, pop-infused journey that feels perfect in this tape :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that chorus on minds of men is just perfect- dropping her voice down to feel more gritty, more noticeably expressive is such a great choice for a song of this nature and this lyrical content; I love it :)</li>
	<li>interlude moment again</li>
	<li>woah I was not expecting this sort of track :O

		<ul>
			<li>god damn it comes off so effortlessly appealing; that first verse from twigs was amazing :))</li>
			<li>and both jorja smith and unknown t have rly good contributions to this, both providing a great amount of energy in much different ways; great stuff ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>interlude moment again again</li>
	<li>while I get more lyrical substance than instrumental appeal at the verses of thank you song, damn that explosion of sound at the chorus is absolutely incredible, and adds so much to the experience of this final track :o

		<ul>
			<li>the final chorus especially just feels like such an ethereal, loving, meaningful ballad coming together in a beautiful way; i love it, fantastic end to an experimental piece :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
