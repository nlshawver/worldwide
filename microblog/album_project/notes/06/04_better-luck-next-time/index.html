<h1>mini notes for better luck next time.</h1>

<ul>
	<li>honestly kinda cool interlude- it&#39;s not super special or mind-blowing, but it seems to open things in an interesting way with the strings behind it :)</li>
	<li>alright I was not feeling riddle at all at the start, especially with how shallow I initially interpreted that first verse... but the chorus with that insane bass :o

		<ul>
			<li>that unique, distinctly hyperpop sound added some extra merit to something I wasn&#39;t initially interested in ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yea, and I have similar feelings towards i know you hate me; like yes the merit of the track is a common, often relatable experience, but the way it&#39;s conveyed is only interesting to me bc of the instrumental

		<ul>
			<li>it&#39;s just very surface-level... which could be cool if you&#39;re into that, but I am not :/</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>unfortunately there&#39;s not much redeeming car seats at all for me though- the instrumental feels weak and played out, the sound of the track and the lyrical content is maybe more shallow... I don&#39;t know, I can only assume this all comes from a serious place for midwxst, but it&#39;s just hitting all the wrong buttons for me so far :c</li>
	<li>okay okay thank god, switching sides came around in a really good way to save this (technically) EP for me; that instrumental on that verse is huge and chaotically beautiful, the lyrics felt a bit more personable, and the beep after the first SUV line completed it :D

		<ul>
			<li>fantastic outro too ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>unfortunately that more compelling narrative doesn&#39;t stick for long, as misery just delves right back into that sad boy aesthetic that makes this project alright at best :(</li>
	<li>yea how am I supposed to take this seriously when one of the first lyrics of step back is &quot;my mind slowly sinks into a big ass abyss&quot; come on, give me something to dig into, something to work with

		<ul>
			<li>I know there&#39;s compelling stuff here, it&#39;s j not executed great in my eyes :,(</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>tbh though, okay starts pretty well and has a compelling beat and pretty good lyrical start to it all- the feature from brakence splits up the aesthetic while still keeping with the theme well...

		<ul>
			<li>yea this might be my second favorite track, even if it&#39;s still w bit of a gap between it and switching sides</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>nvm, on my mind might be my second favorite now- it doesn&#39;t have the same hyperpop inflections, but the vocal passages float really well over this instrumental- it&#39;s not all too deep or anything like that, but the voice intonations and all that (especially towards the beginning) were pretty good :)</li>
</ul>
