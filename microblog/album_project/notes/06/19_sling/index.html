<h1>mini notes for sling</h1>

<ul>
	<li>the instrumental after the first stanza of bambi is absolutely beautiful… I just wanted to say that now, I’m letting myself soak the rest of the sound in c:

		<ul>
			<li>what a meaningful song to start the record with; the power struggle (probably) shown in the lyrics is incredibly relatable, and comes off as incredibly meaningful ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damnn that first chorus on amoeba :D

		<ul>
			<li>expanding from record label woes to the feeling of not reaching the potential of yourself (along with the pressures of keeping others happy) is an insane progression</li>
			<li>and I’m glad the track is so damn groovy :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>…holy shit, partridge was a gut punch I was not expecting- the singing is so well done with how delicate yet curt the delivery is, and how slightly ethereal but off-kilter the harmonies are

		<ul>
			<li>it makes the memories and relationship woes feel more genuine, more substantive and meaningful ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>zinnias is a nice recovery though, pleasantly ascribing goals to living close to those you know care for you, and vice versa; it’s a nice little instrumental to go along with it, but it mostly plays out without a ton of thought given to each aspect I think</li>
	<li>but right back to the heavy stuff with blouse— I won’t pretend to understand the struggles presented, but the way they’re conveyed is precise and methodical, which just makes the messaging it’s delivered in (and the kinda forced humor halfway through) that much more meaningful…</li>
	<li> “at least somebody’s home” that hit really damn well before the saxophones and the developed instrumental :O

		<ul>
			<li>yea the contrast and shift between the instrumental breaks and clairo dropping lines delving into deep philosophical topics is a wonderful split; it’s just an interesting premise that (to me) is executed really well :))</li>
			<li>wade ends extra beautifully :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and the way it goes into harbor is done really well; the track itself feels like another downtempo relationship ballad that, while slightly unoriginal in the themes of this record, feels wholly distinct with the strings and specific lines clairo sings :)</li>
	<li>“it&#39;s stirring, but the ripples always seek out the ones who carry me” what a powerful, effectual way to describe the feelings of anxiety &amp; depression; it can be a visceral response, and the way it can affect those around you is something that can, at times, amplify the feelings inward… and that’s a huge thing to respond to in one’s life

		<ul>
			<li>it’s delivered well, and the violin that sparingly appears at times in this instrumental is beautiful…</li>
			<li>lyrically the ending feels perfect too, what a track :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh joanie being a confident, expressive instrumental to follow right after is such a smart, wondrous moment on the record :D

		<ul>
			<li>OOOH the synth organ c:</li>
			<li>yea the descent for the final minutes feels warranted- what a lovely, meaningful, and necessary instrumental respite :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>reaper being the track name of a song discussing not being a mother is a wild choice; the relatively short track does explore the theme well, and it’s something that (despite not being a woman) I can definitely understand ^^</li>
	<li>the dogs are near? WHERE?

		<ul>
			<li>little changes is a worthwhile ballad tho; it’s not the clearest moment, switching themes and notable moments in the run time… but that just adds to the contrast of those two elements imo ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I was a bit worried for the end of the final track and how it would close out, but the split from the chorus to the final verse made the whole thing come together beautifully, closing out with thoughts of future self and the way things will morph and skew in time

		<ul>
			<li>“and just when I start to think it&#39;s ended / another demand commences” and what a good line in that verse</li>
			<li>this track closes out very, very well :))</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
