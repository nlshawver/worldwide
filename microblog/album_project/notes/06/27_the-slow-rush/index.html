<h1>mini notes for the slow rush</h1>

<ul>
	<li>damn that vocal sample reverberating so plainly is a very compelling start to this track and record overall :)

		<ul>
			<li>yea that was a touching, interesting start- and I’m glad it had the track time to grow just a bit, w the right level of instrumental change and intrigue ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the thoughts and passages devoted to love and the questioning of choices and paths taken is a really interesting take, given that it’s more-so inclined to marriage instead of a lost love; I really like it in between the opener and</li>
	<li>one of the best songs he’s ever made- I might be biased in that I’ve listened to borderline 97 (now 98) times according to itunes… but goddamn this track is special :D

		<ul>
			<li>the meaning of this track, and the way it comes across as effortlessly as being at a certain crossroads, a certain point in one’s life is done perfectly; “standing at the edge of a strange new world. any further and I won’t know the way back.” :o</li>
			<li>those aren’t lyrics, that’s kevin’s meaning behind the track, and it sums it up so damn well ^</li>
			<li>the sound of the track is just so perfectly arranged, w the ethereal vocals both in focus and behind the instrumental… and the instrumental itself :OO</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit that bass line and general explosion of synth noise and chaos on the first chorus of posthumous forgiveness encapsulates instrumentally the feelings of sorrow and loneliness with the estranged relationship… what a powerful first part :O

		<ul>
			<li>that split into the second part was executed wonderfully- the harsh, overblown synths right into the calmed down, subdued, and more calculated bass synths is another thematic shift that’s formed w sound :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>but nothing is like breathe deeper, my god :OOO

		<ul>
			<li>though I’ve listened to borderline 98 times, I have listened to breathe deeper 137 times- and it’s such a wonderful journey, with that effortlessly catchy bass line transitioning into calming synth leads and keys… it’s so appealing and empowering in the perfect way to me :D</li>
			<li>and the second part is—while subtle and instrumental—feels necessary to complete the incessant cadence of the track :)</li>
			<li>I have now listened to breathe deeper 138 times c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly tomorrow’s dust is a bit of an interesting cut- the typical vocals might be a bit mildly unimpactful, but the instrumental and the trip it takes makes up for that small drop after breathe deeper</li>
	<li>and yea, on track is a bit of a lull as well- I understand that it’s about succeeding in where you are rn (that’s the whole point), but it just comes off a bit weak to me

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a confident, sometimes really cool track, but only for some brief moments I think</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>lost in yesterday is a really damn good cut right after though- the message underlaid under another effortlessly effectual and catchy-as-all-hell instrumental is really nice to me :)

		<ul>
			<li>the theme of letting go of the past is perfect ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit is it true might be one of the most interesting tracks here that I hadn’t heard prior- it has such a great bass section creeping beautifully along with the vocals of careful optimism, and damn those shrill synths are an earworm :D</li>
	<li>same thing goes with it might be time; the instrumental is a bit excessive and bombastic, but the way it treats that eccentricity is endearing as all hell, and the personality behind the lyrics is (yet again and as usual) amazing :)</li>
	<li>glimmer is a beautiful little interlude though, I have to be honest; it doesn’t amount to a lot, but the break before the closer is valuable ^</li>
	<li>god damn that explosion and anthemic guitar riff is fantastic on one more hour- it’s bombastic and exciting without being boorish at all :o

		<ul>
			<li>the very subtle and downplayed chorus is a very touching piece in the track’s runtime too, my god- and the way it comes back in all distorted to hell and back :O</li>
			<li>those outro vocals to close it out too… what a way to close this whole thing out- it feels so complete while still being unsure of time and the future and the things it’ll lead to</li>
			<li>what an LP, close behind innerspeaker in my favorites list :))</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
