<h1>mini notes for cosmogramma</h1>

<ul>
	<li>alright what tf is this intro :o</li>
	<li>I’m just already taken aback by these sounds, but the careful harmony that comes through under this absolutely chaotic and classically-idm instrumental is surprising and perfect :)

		<ul>
			<li>pickled! is a great “full” track to start off with, that bass is really nice c:</li>
			<li>that split into it starting again, and then right into…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>nose art is incredible w that intro :D

		<ul>
			<li>with that both haunting and comfortable sample, this record is shaping up to be the modern day equivalent to a classic jazz record :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>intro//a cosmic drama is a fantastic cut with the harp, it feels like a start of some hope, without feeling confident in that proposal

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a beautiful composition :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and it leads perfectly into the complete switch-up of zodiac shit, my god :o

		<ul>
			<li>the flip right back into these crazed drums and vocal samples is beautiful, especially that little flip around the 0:40 mark (?) it’s that deep voice sample, you’ll know it</li>
			<li>the whole track is an intriguing experience, that flips in on itself into just a crazed, off-kilter ballad (that, while composed with no vocals, feels effortlessly emotional)</li>
			<li>that ending especially was beautiful</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and of course there’s another switch-up into the synth-laden chaos of computer face//pure being

		<ul>
			<li>god that synth bass that comes through under everything is absolutely incredible :D</li>
			<li>one of my favorite moments so far, jesus christ :))</li>
			<li>it’s genuinely almost playful in the way it crushes any sort of consistent rhythm in the bridges, while maintaining this same pots &amp; pans type aesthetic over the whole thing</li>
			<li>beautiful harmony and a wonderful track c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>this mf thom yorke thinks he’s so cool

		<ul>
			<li>yea he is nvm</li>
			<li>and while I like the sentiment of the track, it does feel just like an ethereal moment that might not carry the same meaning personally as it seems flylo has intended it to</li>
			<li>it still comes across great, and the whole track with yorke alongside him is something I will never turn down :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>arkestry in addition feels like another interesting sidestep; I’m unsure how I feel about it overall, even if the harm towards the end and the general cohesion of the track is lovely ^^

		<ul>
			<li>it just didn’t stick out as blatantly as some prior cuts, which I can’t knock it for, especially if that’s the path the record takes</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>mmmhmm comes through beautifully right after though, damn :o

		<ul>
			<li>that meshing of the instrumental and the careful harmony with thundercat’s voice is perfect :D</li>
			<li>wonderful track in the middle of the record, and surprisingly the longest track altogether</li>
			<li>honestly that ending is just light-hearted; it lightens some of the tension off the instrumentals ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>although I’ll be honest in saying that I didn’t love it continuing so much into the next track, do the astral plane

		<ul>
			<li>oh my god the instrumental that follows is jaw-dropping in the way it builds though; absolutely magnificent stuff in the way flylo crafted this entire experience :ooo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>satelllliiiiiiiteee kinda confused me at first with that vocal line repeating itself three times in a row, but after it faded away and lifted the instrumental into the main spotlight…

		<ul>
			<li>it was a beautiful change no doubt, and a lovely track; I just got a bit caught out I think c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I think german haircut fits the bill in what it’s trying to do; it may not have connected as much with me, but by ending—with that harp ringing out beautifully—it’s hard not to feel it accomplished its crazed, intricate mission perfectly :)</li>
	<li>that deep kick-drum on recoiled is absolutely lovely, and the warbly bass kinda got to me too; maybe not in the best, most consistent way though; it’s a bit weird and grating to the ears after a bit… which is weird given its relative normality to this instrumental behind it :o

		<ul>
			<li>holy shit nevermind, the way it comes back powerfully—right before the 3:00 mark—is just… god damn that was actually really mf good :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my god, I was going to comment on the way dance of the pseudo nymph started, but the whole track is absolutely wild—which I guess is nothing new, but it felt especially so; a kind of moment that holds a bit of an emotional climax at the way it ends :o</li>
	<li>the way that drips//auntie’s harp stems in right after seems perfectly executed too; it’s a wonderful follow-up, and especially after the strings and wind instruments get there chance at the spotlight here

		<ul>
			<li>the voice that echoes away towards the end is a great sign for</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>table tennis to come right after; and while I wasn’t really connecting well with how overtly plain the sample and matching instrumental felt side-by-side… it did really turn into a beautiful track with laura darlington at the helm

		<ul>
			<li>it feels like an exposed moment, even if the lyrics are just all about the physics of a table tennis game; it feels larger than that singular scope, in an unspoken kind of way c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I guess it’s no surprise then that galaxy in janaki feels like a triumphant conclusion as it sets in and establishes its place beautiful, with that wonderful harmony intersecting the snare flourishes and freaked out synth patchwork

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a beautiful amalgam to finish off the tracklist, and an emotional stop to a shockingly meaningful record :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
