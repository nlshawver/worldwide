<h1>mini notes for run the jewels 3</h1>

<ul>
	<li>pretty good start to the 3rd album, especially with killer mike basically opening up about dealing drugs and his past experiences ^</li>
	<li>that transition into talk to me is incredible though, and that explosion of emotion from mike is amazing :O

		<ul>
			<li>el-p’s verse is an even more direct blast, and the outro is great too; “my dick got a michelin star” that’s all I needed to hear</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god damn- the punchy beat and visceral verses trading back and forth between el and mike on legend has it will never get old, what a mf song :OO

		<ul>
			<li>“we move among the ones you think are meek” that’s all you need to know about their political messaging here, it’s a very powerful way of presenting it ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit call ticketron is an even more creeping, subtly aggressive cut to follow up with- and yet again the back-and-forth verses are incessantly appealing :D</li>
	<li>hey kids (bumaye) is a bit more of the same with a different backdrop, but the political messaging is a bit more obvious and direct in a good way; danny brown’s contribution at the back end is pretty good too, feeling wholly unique while still fitting in with this LP :)</li>
	<li>both stay gold and don’t get captured are nice cuts afterwards, but the instrumentals not feeling as unique or as purely compelling makes it genuinely the only (very slight) decline in quality so far for me

		<ul>
			<li>I might prefer stay gold a bit more though, the gaddafi line fit rly well with the theme c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I was initially thinking the same for thieves!, but with those last two verses, one from el-p and one from killer mike, the inflection and very direct undertones of police oppression and overcoming that were executed pretty well ^

		<ul>
			<li>tunde adebimpe’s bridge at the end was something I wasn’t initially huge about, but it is a really touching, more emotive vocal piece right before a very fitting mlk sample :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>alright alright, and while for the past few tracks I’ve been trying to search for the moments I liked in a song, 2100 is genuinely special with the hook from boots coming off so beautifully in the mix; the messaging comes through effortlessly from mike and el-p as well, and the whole progression of the track is masterful :D

		<ul>
			<li>i love it, this is a peak at the start of this second half :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>panther like a panther might not be as calculated in its arrangement (to me at least), but god damn that instrumental is something to behold, and trina’s hook is a wonderful addition :)</li>
	<li>everybody stay calm might be the cut that just kinda passed from one ear to the other; it wasn’t bad at all, but at this point in this record I’m getting a bit taken out of it</li>
	<li>oh mama has at least an interesting instrumental, and the lyrics are almost ridiculous at times, but again- it’s wearing a bit thin, and I just want to know how well this closes out at this point :/</li>
	<li>okay, despite any qualms I have with other parts of this record- thursday in the danger room is an absolutely crushing cut, describing in detail the emotional terror and reconciling from a close friend dying… and that is something that I can never criticize, especially when it comes off so heartfelt, so genuine…

		<ul>
			<li>kamasi washington is the perfect counterpart on the cut; his inflection and style with the saxophone is beautifully mixed :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>a report to the shareholders / kill your masters was definitely a great track, I’m just a bit taken aback by its placement after such an emotive, personal cut right before it

		<ul>
			<li>de la rocha will never not be a good addition though, great stuff ^</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
