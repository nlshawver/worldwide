<h1>mini notes for summertime &#39;06</h1>

<ul>
	<li>these notes will be stripped down just a bit because of summer stress and bedtime listening, but I&#39;ll do my best to fill in the details ^</li>
	<li>the commentary and insane instrumental on lift me up is a fantastic start to this &#39;double&#39; album, really loving the stylistic start :)</li>
	<li>yea holy shit, norf norf is a fantastic track to follow-up with, having a more stripped back instrumental as a trade-off for absolutely staggering verses :D</li>
	<li>birds and bees continues a perfect streak, with a memorable, beautiful hook from daley, mixed between characteristic vince verses c:</li>
	<li>while slightly shallow in its content, loca has another great, minimal beat- and some compelling lyrics despite the obvious meaning from the start</li>
	<li>wow- and while I wasn&#39;t initially sold on either lemme know or dopeman, my god the female features drive those tracks to a whole other level (even if dopeman is a shorter track); lemme know I feel is a better lyrical continuation of loca (thank you jhené aiko), and dopeman had most of its merit with it&#39;s heavy instrumental and kilo kish :D</li>
	<li>the questioning of vince&#39;s control of his vices is such a fantastic way to follow up dopeman, which seems to set the stage powerfully before such a cut :O</li>
	<li>okay... this record was batting .950 up until this point, but while both vince and future have good contributions- god I hate this instrumental after how unique and compelling each and every beat was before this

		<ul>
			<li>it just feels fake and so past the moment for both the theme and production</li>
			<li>the ending is pretty hard though I have to be honest; it&#39;s definitely the best that could&#39;ve been done, and did surprise me a bit :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>to be honest tho... right when the meaning of summertime came though, I did get señorita a bit more, with how direct and stream-of-consciously vince portrays himself

		<ul>
			<li>it&#39;s like a backtracking of sorts, which makes the prior track feel better for that wild moment of trap excitement and half-rage</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while just as weird as pt. 1, pt. 2 feels better with earl by his side, a bit able to reconcile and get the start of the second half underway</li>
	<li>3230 feels a bit more blatantly focused on the LBC yet again, and has a similar, shockingly effective methodology as lift me up :)

		<ul>
			<li>i just hope it can stay interesting for another whole half</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>surf is a pretty good return with kilo kish, but doesn&#39;t feel nearly as wondrous; however the theme of poverty explicitly is something that adds a ton to the track, making it something unique in a record of sustained interest imo c:</li>
	<li>might be wrong has an amazing start with hames fauntleroy and haneef talib; it yet again shocks with being a downtempo, perceptive look into the perceptions of others and how it can be trapping in an environment like where vince grew up :o

		<ul>
			<li>while the instrumentals are nothing to scoff at, and are genuinely fantastical 90% of the time, yea the greater meanings of the actual words put to paper morphs this into something special :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the focus on money is obvious in get paid, but man that first verse captivates so easily into the track- it might be another kinda weak point overall, but the instrumental rises to pick up the slack, and forms a useful west-side anthem ^^</li>
	<li>the braggadocio of street punks is incessantly catchy, and I love whatever that half-marimba, half vibraphone piece of the instrumental is- such a nice touch in an already captivating cut :)</li>
	<li>unfortunately, yea hang &#39;n&#39; bang is the most grating track on the record so far; sometimes it can be to its benefit, semi-notably with a$ton matthew&#39;s verse, but... this is the worst song here :|</li>
	<li>and while it doesn&#39;t seem terribly like a return to the peak of this double LP, c.n.b. is a good cut to begin the cooldown towards the ending ^</li>
	<li>alright damn- like it is is a wonderfully balanced cut, juggling a wild instrumental and screwed sample into a fantastic cut before the closer

		<ul>
			<li>those spoken bridges between the verses and hooks are beautiful moments, forming a vignette of soul, speaking of heaven, treating your mom well, making her proud, and overall improving who you are by the time death comes...</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and what a cliffhanger; it&#39;s one of those cuts you would&#39;ve liked to have seen fleshed out (thanks adult swim), but in the context of the record, it paints a</li>
</ul>
