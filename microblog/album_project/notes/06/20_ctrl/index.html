<h1>mini notes for ctrl</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I wasn’t not convinced of the starting track supermodel from the start, but damn the second verse and the second chorus hit so much harder with the stronger lyrics, introduction of the drums, and just the overall feel of the growth— right before the fade-out :o</li>
	<li>the finesse and stream-of-conscious it seems like comes through on sza’s lengthy contribution in the first part of love galore is pretty damn good, and travis’s verse contrasts and adds a good amount to the track’s meaning and explorations of love and sex; it’s well-constructed, and something that holds even more meaning from how it plays out ^</li>
	<li>holy shit… doves in the wind is such an interesting moment; kendrick’s verse plays out in an absurd kind of way, but the praise in this anthem doesn’t go unnoticed :O

		<ul>
			<li>it’s just something I’m gonna have to listen to again to figure out better lol</li>
			<li>probably the most notable track so far, even if supermodel was a fantastic opener too :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that chorus on drew barrymore; those layered vocals that feel enveloping come across very, very well :oo

		<ul>
			<li>yea what a beautiful track, it feels so special at this point in the tracklist/runtime, being thematically about low self-esteem and the attempts to overcome it or comprehend why it’s there to begin with…</li>
			<li>sza’s singing voice is the perfect fit for tracks like this, it’s so smooth yet minutely detailed at the same time :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>prom is a really well made pop/disco track to follow, and the thematic touch (and sza’s own comments) about living in the moment, change in people around you, and going to miami with your mom instead of prom is a great fit after a track like drew barrymore :)

		<ul>
			<li>it also just sounds amazing c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damnn that bass on the weekend :OO

		<ul>
			<li>holy shit, the vocals that, in my headphones, feel like they’re from a person next to me (with lots of echoes) made me jump because of how realistic it sounded… my heart rate is still going crazy from that lol</li>
			<li>it’s a really touching track though, splitting between perspectives and molding an image of unloyal men and how it affects women trying to either be real or in a relationship (or both)</li>
			<li>whatever way of describing it, it’s a really great imagining and culmination of those feelings</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>great transition into go gina, damn :o

		<ul>
			<li>and it’s a really great little anthem; it’s pretty simple, but the theme is simple too, of letting go and actually being able to enjoy life and what comes with it, relaxing with those you love around you :)</li>
			<li>it’s a positive, loving cut c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>what a span of tracks—garden (say it like dat) is another wondrous track, this time leaning of themes of imposter syndrome and situations feeling way too good to be true, and your (sza’s) reactions to those times… what great themes with neo-soul and modern r&amp;b flavored instrumentals :D</li>
	<li>broken clocks might be the first time the instrumental and general aesthetic feels like a repeat, but the vocals and differing points of view keep it fresh enough to make it last, and last well :)</li>
	<li>that first verse on anything, after such a different drum sound, feels so playful and intriguing— the beep beep got me :D

		<ul>
			<li>it’s yet again thematically very consistent, and fits in really well</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the wavy interlude feels slightly out of place though- it’s still a good track, but it seems to not amount to much despite splitting anything and normal girl well ^</li>
	<li>normal girl is consistently compelling despite the same feelings of wanting to have a set love life outside of sex stretching for the whole runtime- and damn that outro is special; I really like the whole thing, it feels slightly ethereal in its overall aesthetic, and it molds well around that sound :)</li>
	<li>and again, while it maybe feels a bit weak or unsteady in the tracklist (at least compared to the other peaks of the record), the emotive way sza and isaiah interweave those feelings of being completely enveloped in admiration and love for a partner is done really well :o</li>
	<li>but my god, the way 20 something references not having everything together, but not wanting to fall victim to the same cycles as what you lived with before—along with friends slowly disappearing and “growing up” to become parents with day jobs, and just the entire aesthetic of it

		<ul>
			<li>it’s magical and heart-wrenching, and just such a great cap to the record, having a very similar aesthetic to the track that started this whole lp :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that ending felt so heartwarming too, damn what a good mom c:</li>
</ul>
