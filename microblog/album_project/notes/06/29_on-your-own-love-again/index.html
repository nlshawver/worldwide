<h1>mini notes for on your own love again</h1>

<ul>
	<li>wow, was not expecting this kind of atmosphere on the record- it’s a really lo-fi, minimally produced track to start… and that first chorus feels airy and beautiful :o

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a bit understated w the theme, but it comes through nicely ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I’m surprisingly conflicted w game that I play; I kinda like the strung arpeggios, and the overall aesthetic is pleasant but slightly off-putting at the same time… but I can’t really connect with jessica’s voice on this track :/

		<ul>
			<li>it’s not bad, and I really like that outro and the added cohesion it brings to the track; I just don’t like some of the vocal flairs she uses rather often on the track</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>strange hand gets close to reaching the same pleasures and intricacies that I liked on the opening track, and I love her voice and what comes after the first chorus :)

		<ul>
			<li>might be my favorite track so far, simply due to the different delivery of the vocals, and the fact that the whole track’s aura feels almost cryptic as it passes by; “say you ran from the shadows you cast” is a great way to start the verse (that repeats, but still)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the chorus on greycedes, while returning to that same vocal inflection I wasn’t a huge fan of, is genuinely done very well; the final two lines, “oh, stargazer, gaze for awhile / let me love you, baby” is both really pleasant to hear, and delivered very, very well c:

		<ul>
			<li>the strings after that second time around are beautiful on the outro too :)</li>
			<li>really nice half-interlude to come after strange melody ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh that first verse of moon dude: “moon dude, you can try the weight / of your body now in outer space / in time, you can cast a gaze on our planet lines” damn that’s beautiful, both times it’s delivered :D

		<ul>
			<li>this track is genuinely astounding, I love the everything about it- the understated yet still compelling theme, the vocal delivery, and the layered string son the second chorus; what a track :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that second stanza on jacquelyn in the background (what comes before ‘oh, dear jacquelyn’) is beautiful; another small section I love c:

		<ul>
			<li>“deep inside my lonely room / i cry the tears of never knowing you” god damn… another vivid picture that makes this whole experience surprisingly engaging and wondrous :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>i’ve got a feeling has another beautifully delivered set of lines, and I really like it for that / that’s all I have to say honestly, the praise I’ve levied the way of other tracks all applies to this as well :))

		<ul>
			<li>it’s an understated hit on the record imo ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>her voice has completely grown on me, I love her inflections and the small vocal notes that make her voice really distinct and unique :)

		<ul>
			<li>back, baby is that moment I got there; it’s pretty much the last full track, but it ties the whole thing nicely together on an experience level to me</li>
			<li>both verses are effortlessly smooth, and alluring in their content and matching aesthetics and schemes; both verses mirror one another; “saw a paper with the header that your love is just a myth I devised” matches up perfectly with “that you’d better reconsider all the love you took and then cast aside” in the next verse</li>
			<li>that’s amazing, I love that :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while it doesn’t amount to much, the title track outerlude is a nice closer for the whole project; rly good stuff, even if I was off-put at the start ^^</li>
</ul>
