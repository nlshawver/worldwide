<h1>mini notes for atrocity exhibition</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I knew this was going to be experimental, but damn I was not expecting what came through on the first track; I probably came to appreciate the sound of danny’s voice by the second verse, which made me look better into what he was saying

		<ul>
			<li>the instrumental came through really well at the end there too :)</li>
			<li>I just needed a bit of a warm-up I think</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oooh that drum beat that explodes at the second verse :O

		<ul>
			<li>the way he rides the beat here is absolutely incredible, I love the way it just keeps building and building; that hook is like butter :D</li>
			<li>weird to hear him so calm too ;)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the hook from petite noir on rolling stone is a wonderful contrast, and adds really well to the overall aesthetic of the track

		<ul>
			<li>danny’s verses are relatively good too, and they do have the almost melancholic meaning to back up their place on the song :o</li>
			<li>yea petite noir was wonderful on this song :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>alright alright, really doe starts amazingly; both danny’s verse and kendrick’s hook are a wonderful set piece to start off on— and while ab-soul does pretty well on his verse, that hook to bridge to verse for kendrick is as amazing as the start of this track, and earl might end off the track even better :D

		<ul>
			<li>genuinely just a fantastic (almost) posse cut, with great contributions and interesting lines from each person involved :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that vocal sample on lost makes the song feel both creeping and half-haunting, setting the stage really damn well- danny has a good progression on the track too, but to me it stays in its lane, a bit isolated</li>
	<li>HOLY that beat on ain’t it funny :O

		<ul>
			<li>what a fucking beat, the verses from danny are incessantly detailed and catchy as hell, and the wavey synth that surrounds the rumbling beat under it is SO mf good :DD</li>
			<li>yea danny has some of his best, most intriguing, and esoteric lines on the whole record on this track c:</li>
			<li>what a fuckin track, my god</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>with golddust too (and its incredible instrumental as well), the actual content of what danny’s been saying about dealing with drug addiction and the vices alongside it finally come through really well, with the song almost being an explosive realization of it altogether :o

		<ul>
			<li>really compelling stuff, and it gives a whole lot of meaning to the wild experimentation and grating instrumentals + vocals that have so far been present</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I think the meaning of white lines might be obvious just from the name…

		<ul>
			<li>and the track feels good in the way, and that subtly haunting note it ends on after fearing his death from those very drugs he’s talked so much about is a rly nice touch ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>pneumonia is a wildly compelling track in this streak of wondrous experimentation and drug-fueled ventures- the instrumental gives the whole experience of the track a lot of extra weight, but danny by himself is always interesting, and his verses are executed really, really well :)</li>
	<li>dance in the water is an interesting spot for a banger about twerking, but it goes off without a hitch, even if it adds little to the experience of this record</li>
	<li>from the ground feels like a wholly different set of emotions, focusing on the past and wherever danny was however long ago; it’s a wonderful track, letting the emotive lyrics come through for just a bit, with some fantastic help from kelela :))</li>
	<li>woah— when it rain is a genuinely frantic, all-encompassing track, and the way it’s simply about things spiraling out of control at the first sign of trouble, it fits absolutely perfect with the way it builds

		<ul>
			<li>what a track for the backend of this LP, danny’s verses are consistently intriguing in the way he explodes with no sluggish execution :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>today covering death and the frailness of life is a really interesting topic to keep going with after such an LP, and the instrumental fits really well

		<ul>
			<li>the hook of the track is really good too :)</li>
			<li>but the whole experience of the record is finally wearing a bit thin, and I just wonder where/how it’ll end</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>get hi has a lot of value to it, but it does feel slightly heavy-handed, maybe a bit slower in the way it goes about itself- not a bad thing, and maybe good for the second-last closer of this record

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a pretty good track :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>hell for it is a beautiful conclusion, having some bright explosions halfway in the mix, and a genuinely fantastic instrumental to pull the curtain on :D</li>
</ul>
