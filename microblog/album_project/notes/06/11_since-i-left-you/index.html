<h1>mini notes for since I left you</h1>

<ul>
	<li>this might be an actual mini note section, especially since it’s very late, and this is a plunderphonics record- but what a magnificent start with the title track :o</li>
	<li>honestly, I fell asleep listening, but there was a great amount here… personally, on first listen, it didn’t amount to a hugely influential experience, but it’s definitely a required revisit on the planned revisiting of these records by years end :)</li>
</ul>
