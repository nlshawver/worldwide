<h1>mini notes for trench</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I think honestly when I first heard jumpsuit (much younger me), I thought it was just kinda meh- but MY GOD that introductory bass line and the way the instrumental ride under tyler when the lyrics actually come in is really mf great c:

		<ul>
			<li>THAT EXPLOSION when the chorus ends :DDD</li>
			<li>the bridge feels a bit understated, but god damn his screamed vocals into the chorus gives me fucking goosebumps every damn time :O</li>
			<li>what a perfect opener, holy shit…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn alright, levitate is a really compelling cut to come right after; it has a perfect transition, and that incessant drum beat is done so well under some really good lines and lyrical content- great sort of transitionary track :)</li>
	<li>morph is much more mellowed out than the other openers here, but the lyrical connection, tying ‘morphing’ and the track title into a defense mechanism against a sort of existential dread is really interesting- and it makes up for a bit of that nagging feeling I have that this instrumental may be a bit stretched thin

		<ul>
			<li>it’s still a wondrous experience; that outro is executed perfectly after such a track :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while my blood starts off a bit weird and honestly sounding undeveloped with tyler’s bare vocals- the instrumental (especially that bass work and general soundscape) comes in a very intriguing way, and it elevates the track’s aesthetic into a confident yet reserved ballad :)

		<ul>
			<li>god damn that final chorus is executed wonderfully- that’s definitely a highlight this record, both individually on this cut and everywhere else; the ability to have those powerful, well-executed, and never too grating explosions of character and instrumentation is a very refined skill :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I wasn’t initially as sold on chlorine either… and while it didn’t reach the same euphoric highs as some other cuts here, that third verse (and the rest of the track honestly) had some wonderful personality and wordplay with the lyrics, adding rly well to that theme of music being a kind of cathartic retreat :o

		<ul>
			<li>insanely relatable, and presented in a way that isn’t pandering or patronizing- I love that so damn much c:</li>
			<li>the outro completes the overall experience rly well too, the pitched vocals adding a good amount to that aesthetic</li>
			<li>the fact that it’s only been twenty minutes and five tracks, and it’s this good… I am in awe :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yea I kinda agree w general sentiment that smithereens is the weakest track so far- while I really like the loving nature of the track, it does feel a bit off after such a heavy, melancholic track like chlorine

		<ul>
			<li>I guess in a way it’s a representation of what indulging in those feelings from before can get you, but it does just come off as a bit off in the tracklist I think</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit- neon gravestones, besides the former cut, had the weakest impact on me at first, but with the message of non-glorification of suicide, and treasuring one’s life instead of focusing on their death, imminent or recent… it’s absolutely beautiful and touching, and I really appreciate the thematic passages that come through all over it :oo</li>
	<li>the hype is just a great cut to follow- that hook is an incessant earworm, and yet again the theme matches up well with both the instrumental and the placement in the tracklist :)

		<ul>
			<li>the ukulele is a bit much, but I don’t even care- the whole track is such a celebration of your accomplishments, and not succumbing to that existential dread or those societal pressures</li>
			<li>it’s pandering in just the right way I guess, especially w that last chorus and the bridge to it ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“what a beautiful day for making a break for it” what a great start to the second verse in a shrouded metaphor for depression and overcoming its wrath; the whole track has careful desperation written all over it, but a confidence in being able to conquer whatever is at those ‘walls,’ that central allegory in both the music and the music videos (and the convoluted web content served alongside this LP)

		<ul>
			<li>the track is another bright spot behind the guise of life’s shitty experiences, and I love the way it comes across c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh that harmony on the chorus of cut my lip is so damn good :D

		<ul>
			<li>this fits so well after nico and the niners; it’s a bit more steady, a bit more confident even after a traumatic event— and it feels so damn happy to be succeeding despite that shit happening</li>
			<li>I fucking love this song, this made me tear up a bit towards the middle…</li>
			<li>and that bass line that comes through so clearly between the last chorus and the outro is such a great addition- josh’s work on this record cannot be overstated :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“but I’m still not sure if fear’s a rival or close relative of truth” alright alright, that line got me fully into bandito; I understand that this is the culmination of escape in the case of the story, but it seems interesting that it’s so damn understated and almost somber despite that release :o

		<ul>
			<li>nvm here it comes, how is this gonna be?</li>
			<li>what the hell? it’s like a disco anthem after a raw instrumental before it- that came out of nowhere and I kinda love it c:</li>
			<li>it’s just such a weird, calculated, yet uniquely goofy expression of newfound control in one’s life, and I think it comes to fruition really nicely :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>my god that second verse on pet cheetah was actually insane- I wasn’t expecting both that fucking jason statham line, or the really appealing and skillful bars from tyler :ooo

		<ul>
			<li>really great stuff, and while the theme is more understated in terms of cohesion of the record, it’s a really nice touch after bandito ^^</li>
			<li>god damn that outro :OO</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay, I’ve celebrated a lot of this record… but the connection of legend to neon gravestones, and praising his grandfather’s life despite his no longer being in tyler’s life—it connected to me on an emotional level I wasn’t expecting, and was another moment that had me in shock at how well developed, determined, and purposefully designed this record is c:

		<ul>
			<li>what a track, my god…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while it’s relatively mellow and almost sedated for a good majority of its runtime, leave the city is a great closer- it admits that it’s not entirely done, and there’s still work to be done

		<ul>
			<li>it has that grandiose instrumental rise, but the way it resolves feels accurate to the exact feelings described all over this record</li>
			<li>this is a magnificent album with a great closer :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
