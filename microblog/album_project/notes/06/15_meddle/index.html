<h1>mini notes for meddle</h1>

<ul>
	<li>alright this is going to be insane isn’t it?</li>
	<li>that bass work from both waters and gilmour interweave insanely well on one of these days, and after mason provides a bit-crushed line threatening a dj he doesn’t like, that explosion of sound comes enveloping around you :o

		<ul>
			<li>god seriously, that deep, almost rumbling bass note that slides up every once in a while is so utterly captivating and makes the very minimal track surprisingly mesmerizing :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>a pillow of winds starts in a subtle way, but that key change shift down (which is handily well done) after “and the candle dies” gives it a sort of still ethereal, yet painfully focused effort of introspection ^^

		<ul>
			<li>the transition work from the wind noises is perfect too :)</li>
			<li>damn that first verse after the instrumental break starts off the most interesting, compelling, and almost calming vocal passage of meddle so far :D</li>
			<li>fantastic end to the track overall I think, with all the strings coming together in a subtle, beautiful way c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I’m still kind of surprised by fearless; the way it started felt completely out of place for the record, but it grew into something of an upbeat reconciliation in the midst of this first side

		<ul>
			<li>it’s not as massively introspective or minutely detailed as the two prior cuts, but it’s still a mess of emotion, sounds, and some more great verses from gilmour :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>san tropez was another sidestep that caught me off guard, feeling nearly folk and jazz-inspired—and having some lyrical passages seemingly calling back to the closing of a pillow of winds

		<ul>
			<li>it takes place rather ethereally on that coast of france, with some compelling guitar work splitting up masterful, verging-on-ambient sounding chords (that I really love tied together :)</li>
			<li>it’s a sort of journey that comes close to ending this section really well ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while it is a bit stupid and done in a way meant to be ridiculous, seamus is honestly a pretty good closer for the tracklist; it’s another left hook, and it’s overall just done completely differently from everything around it :)

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a nice respite before going into the coming journey of echoes…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god damn that piano to start off the track… 2001 type beat

		<ul>
			<li>when the lyrics of echoes finally come in it has already been three minutes of build-up—and it’s honestly useful time spent, as it’s such a well-made instrumental lead :o</li>
			<li>and the fact that all these esoteric, detailed descriptions describe the the formation of earth and humanity and the start of an intertwined relationship is just so fucking wild to me…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>all my homies hate andrew lloyd webber</li>
	<li>ooh, that breakdown at 7 minutes :ooo</li>
	<li>I think the instrumental stays captivating all throughout the track, but at around the 12 minute it delves quickly into a harrowing sort of experiment, setting an auditory stage of unease that (to me) is both captivating and genuinely off-putting…</li>
	<li>the piano coming back in :O

		<ul>
			<li>the chords that come through right after are a beautiful turning point; it feels dishearteningly excited, and while it’s confident, it also feels off in the way the drums come in and the piano sticks around</li>
			<li>it’s consistently uncomfortable comeuppance</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>BUT THE FINAL BUILD-UP :OO</li>
	<li>“a million bright ambassadors of morning” you cheeky fuckers</li>
	<li>AND THE OUTRO :OOO</li>
</ul>
