<h1>mini notes for yeezus</h1>

<ul>
	<li>ooh I love daft punk messing around :)

		<ul>
			<li>jesus christ this is so grating and yet so catchy for no goddamn reason :o</li>
			<li>THE SAMPLE :D</li>
			<li>literally so mf good, jesus christ c:</li>
			<li>rollercoaster of a track; the verse before the last chorus is just so bombastic and in a ridiculously gross, amazing way lol</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>black skinhead is an absolutely landmark track, fucking incredible moment, and even though 300 romans is just wrong... who the fuck GIVES A SHIT, THIS SONG IS SO FUCKING GREAT :DDD

		<ul>
			<li>the meaning of the track might back up that intentional mistake, which—given the fact that ye is a genius that gets so little credit in mainstream media—makes complete sense to me ^^</li>
			<li>but this is a legendary track, I love it so mf much c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly I can get the standoffish nature people can have with this record, especially with how fucking brash this record can be like on i am a god... but that first verse sticks out to me in a little different of a way, and the whole track speaks overconfidently in a sense that feels intwined with the instrumental

		<ul>
			<li>a god doesn&#39;t need maximalist instrumentals to justify its place</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy fucking shit new slaves has an insane instrumental :OOO

		<ul>
			<li>the meaning behind each line hits on some consumeristic materialism, the propaganda system of america, systematic oppression, and so much more</li>
			<li>and that beat switch to the outro at three minutes :oo</li>
			<li>jesus christ, what a shift; and what is frank doing here c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>absolutely classic verse on hold my liquor; I like the back and forth with chief keef and justin vernon, and the verse indicating his maniacal, fuck-whoever-else attitude has won for now

		<ul>
			<li>it has a great outro too, it&#39;s a wonderful amalgamation with the synths and fake(?) strings going at it for control at the end :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit the explosion of i&#39;m in it is insane; the track itself with ye&#39;s verse feels... like a lack of great substance for this

		<ul>
			<li>yea definitely my least favorite moment so far, where even the instrumental doesn&#39;t outweigh what he&#39;s saying</li>
			<li>like yea this is like the bleach line on pablo but a whole track worth of it, which is why it&#39;s so stupid to me; it&#39;s overused as hell, and it just doesn&#39;t amount to an interesting experience</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>which sucks, because blood on the leaves is next; even though I think the starting verse is grating away from any of its deeper meaning, those two choruses and the nina simone sample are insane as hell :o

		<ul>
			<li>genuinely laughed for a second at how perfectly set-up that apartheid line is :O</li>
			<li>incredible second verse with this instrumental; I&#39;ll need the time to see how I can parse the meaning of this whole experience against the instrumentals, but my god it&#39;s wonderful even of that merit alone</li>
			<li>the outro isn&#39;t anything I&#39;d personally write home about (very much at least), even if it fits with the intro verse well</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>even if the lyrics are actually verging on just stupid with guilt trip, the popcaan feature honestly carries it well, especially with the outro and that sparkling synth line :)

		<ul>
			<li>that spoken sample weaving its way into the instrumental is great too :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>king louie might be the first genuinely standout feature, his contribution on that verse is pretty damn good, and this instrumental is yet again insane :OOO

		<ul>
			<li>send it up is definitely a good second closer, and the way it cuts right into...</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>bound 2 might be the best closer ever, what a fucking track; the fake love aesthetic showing itself off in a beautiful way

		<ul>
			<li>it&#39;s purposefully over-sweet, making a mockery of &quot;everything ending perfectly&quot;</li>
			<li>what an incredible sample and instrumental work here too :DD</li>
			<li>inflation joke on one good girl, etc., funny stuff</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
