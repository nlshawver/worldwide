<h1>mini notes for kaleidoscope dream</h1>

<ul>
	<li>that pleasant verse coming through so briefly gives almost no room for an instantly likable chorus to dominate this track- I rly like this start :)

		<ul>
			<li>those hi-hats feel a bit too sharp, but not too distracting I don’t think- it doesn’t take away anything at least ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>woah wth, was not expecting the start of don’t look back at all :O

		<ul>
			<li>that incessant drum beat is absolutely incredible, what a backdrop to a track about his own doubts about his loyalty and dedication; stunning stuff :oo</li>
			<li>those soaring vocals take off without premonition, and it’s again a shockingly pretty moment; I’m floored by the breakdown at the end too, the interpolation and subtly in his voice is great :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my god, use me is a fantastic track that… well you know what it’s about from the content of the song- but the way it plays into that aesthetic and mood is wonderful, with an intriguing, never too bombastic instrumental behind swaying vocal lines :))

		<ul>
			<li>I am continually surprised by the willingness not to be overbearing- each of those final choruses could have been even more massive and extreme… but it wasn’t, because it’s already perfect in the way it floats c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>those bass kicks on do you…, damn :o

		<ul>
			<li>mf what? again with the bit of subversion of my expectations; that almost grainy drum beat that comes in, surrounding the rest of the track—it could’ve been a grossly enveloping mess, but it just wasn’t</li>
			<li>it changed itself from the outset to be something that meshed so well in with the rest, and the theme of this LP shines over it; what a jaw-dropping set of tracks so far :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the title track might be less expressive or monumental as the previous cuts, but it’s still wonderful moment to mark the midsection of the record- and one that encapsulates the feeling well :)</li>
	<li>the thrill is another profound-feeling sort of experience, being completely enveloped in the hope of opportunity, wherever/whatever it may be- it’s minimal in lyrical function, but god the singing and mixing of the instrumental makes its form great :))</li>
	<li>honestly while the instrumental is nothing to scoff at, how many drinks? might be—for total value—the weakest cut here, simply for its overuse of the same theme and choice

		<ul>
			<li>it’s just shallower than some other topics present on the record, that focus on more than just this one aspect of a night ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>if there was going to be a good follow-up though, where’s the fun in forever is that; it’s not expansive by any means, but the way it molds around its theme and instrumentation is as amazing as the first half of this record ^^

		<ul>
			<li>alicia keys is consistently underrated/overhated imo, and her contribution upholds that to me; it’s short but sweet :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that mini-explosion of color into the final refrain—while it’s the one spot on the album that can be definitely seen as bombastic for the sake of it and nothing else—is still appealing in the way it works into the tracks… not subtle theme ;)</li>
	<li>that second to last track though :o

		<ul>
			<li>not much to say about that c;</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while there was a moment in the middle of the closing track that the drum section felt too kitsch for its own good- the whole song is genuinely a pretty good closer for this record

		<ul>
			<li>the final moments may have blended a bit, but it was consistently good the whole way :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
