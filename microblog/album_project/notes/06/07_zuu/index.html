<h1>mini notes for zuu</h1>

<ul>
	<li>great little intro with the title track; the verse is just a little simple for zel, but the hook is really damn good, and it sets the scene really well</li>
	<li>HELL YEAH ricky is such a damn good cut with that warbled, creeping instrumental and the way it flows under some intense, emotional lyrics :D

		<ul>
			<li>I just love that this is a hard asf song just about loving your friends and family, I love the energy it has c:</li>
			<li>“we was three 6, wu-tang mixed with dipset” I absolutely love the way zel carries and delivers that line and the way the instrumental drops out away from it :o</li>
			<li>wonderful cut, and a great little transition :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god that little instrumental intro to wish is amazing, idk what it is about it but I love that moment of respite ^

		<ul>
			<li>PULL UP IN A NAVIGATOR TRUCK, EXCURSION</li>
			<li>hell yea, this track is so damn great with that uniquely special instrumental; it feels perfectly shiny and placed so well under some incredible bars from curry :))</li>
			<li>dude and kiddo marv is absolutely insane, his feature verse is just so damn perfect :D</li>
			<li>batting 100 so far, cause WHAT THE FUCK is that outro beat, shit is BEAUTIFUL :OOO</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>absolutely stunning, almost guttural transition into birdz, god damn :oo

		<ul>
			<li>“fuck a pop-tart, we carry toasters for real” what a bar :)</li>
			<li>honestly while I never dislike rick ross, his presence is already just in line with the song he’s featured on; so all good stuff so far ^^</li>
			<li>what a fucking track, damnn :D</li>
			<li>this four track run is a ten for sure, it’s such a fantastic set of sounds, themes, lyrics… everything is just shooting perfectly c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly I wasn’t sure what to expect from automatic in the tracklist, since I’ve never given it the time of day— and while I think it might be the first drop in cohesive quality of this record, it’s certainly not bad, especially with how detailed and effortlessly charismatic and emotive the verses here feel :)

		<ul>
			<li>the hook is just alright though if we’re being honest with ourselves, but it’s not bad at all ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the intro to speedboat is incredible with that background sample, and just the way it initiates this exorbitant tale of money and pain

		<ul>
			<li>that start to the first verse (and the verse itself) is absolutely an earworm, incredible stuff</li>
			<li>the dial-up sample &gt;&gt;&gt;</li>
			<li>the whole second verse feels like the more emotional moment on the track, especially with the way it starts; the “everything hot boy, texas pete” line splits it up by just being the most beautifully absurd thing ever, but it ends just as important and intriguing as it started :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god that rumbling memphis beat behind the bushy b interlude just makes me want more of it—but it does fit nicely as an interlude</li>
	<li>yoo is such a funny mf moment lmao :DD

		<ul>
			<li>this might be one of the best skits on a record I’ve ever heard, besides maybe the “broke, broke broke, we broke—we ain’t got it” on late registration lol</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>alright uhh… while the instrumental (especially with the way it morphs just slightly in zel’s verse) is pretty damn hard, I just can’t connect much with ice billion berg’s hook

		<ul>
			<li>it’s easy to get used to, especially cause it fits well with this insane cut, but it’s just not my favorite at all ^</li>
			<li>okay I’m used to it, that’s pretty damn good; outro is a great closer to the cut :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while shake 88 is obviously just a strip club anthem, it plays in its lane really well, even if it just sort of fits into this tracklist

		<ul>
			<li>there is the sparing commentary in the hook and zel’s second verse, but that’s about all that I find value in the track :/</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>pretty good interlude, but not much value from it imo; just a cool transition into</li>
	<li>p.a.t. is genuinely one of the hardest songs I’ve heard denzel on, my god :O

		<ul>
			<li>jesus christ that first verse is absolutely incredible, with lines throughout it being just perfectly intoned, reflecting well the shit in carol city, and a fantastic callback anthem to zel’s past and project pat :oo</li>
			<li>perfect interweaving of those past dedications and how curry got to this point :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
