<h1>mini notes for teen dream</h1>

<ul>
	<li>a very nice, subtle beginning to this record w zebra :)

		<ul>
			<li>those first words sung in the first verse are genuinely fantastic, it seems to set the stage beautifully, leading into the following verses and chorus perfectly :D</li>
			<li>the black &amp; white horse serving as the never-true-to-self personality of this figurehead is a great kind of metaphor; it’s both subtle enough and yet detailed in its accusation of careful pain :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh hell yea, absolutely perfect start to silver soul :OO

		<ul>
			<li>god damn, it’s just so effortlessly beautiful and ethereal :D</li>
			<li>jesus christ this is just so perfectly saddening and hopelessly exciting in such a contrast to itself… I’m choking up just listening to it now, it’s so personal without feeling pandering, and the way it weaves in the verses and lands so smoothly on the chorus</li>
			<li>this is one of the best songs I have ever heard—</li>
			<li>this is the first song in this album project that has my head in my hands, sobbing in such a way that just feels like a known summation of all the shit that keeps life tracking downwards</li>
			<li>what a fucking song, it holds such a tight grasp to me and a deep connection…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay now I have to compose myself- norway feels like a slight resurgence, no longer falling into the pit of light despair that can be found in silver soul

		<ul>
			<li>god it just fits so well into a backwards path, being a coming of age that leaves you just as lost as you were before you were even close to becoming an adult :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my fucking god, these lyrics on walk in the park are not helping me rn

		<ul>
			<li>this being an escape from both the pities of the prior track and this unspoken relationship is absolutely heart-breaking—</li>
			<li>the way victoria legrand smoothly arcs into those high notes in the chorus is so damn beautiful, I don’t understand how her voice works in such a setting :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>used to be is another wondrous continuation from the previous cut, feeling like a hand reaching out trying to help, but never quite reaching

		<ul>
			<li>the concern in the vocals fits well with the yet-again interesting instrumental, and it’s just another gripping cut :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oooh, I love that harmony on the start of lover of mine, those layered keys mix perfectly into themselves :D

		<ul>
			<li>the chorus is yet again an ethereally fascinating feature, with the “off to nowhere” chants echoing into the void, demanding no response; the statement is just what it wants to be, and what’s being felt at the time</li>
			<li>the reasons are unexplainable, and that’s perfectly fine :)</li>
			<li>we decide what is right</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“we don’t need a sign to know of better times” god damn, with the rest of the lyrics and their build-up to that moment, it just captures the oblique edges of this track exactly right :)

		<ul>
			<li>the cadence of the bridge is amazing too; that fire / liar rhyme might be cheesy as all hell, but so is this track in its weirdness</li>
			<li>so it gets a good pass c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn— the smooth climax into the chorus of 10 mile stereo feels planned and executed to its subtle, great peak; it’s not bombastic as an artificial and unsubstantial relationship can be, it’s calculated in the steps it takes out of love

		<ul>
			<li>that might look to far into it, but with the imagery of the verses I don’t think it’s very hard to see ^^</li>
			<li>it’s a wondrous slow-burner that captures the energy of such a relationship in its perfect light :))</li>
			<li>there’s peaks and troughs, but the peaks are built-up over a great amount of time and effort that goes into their structure and meaning c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>you know how I know this record is perfect to me? I have not once looked at how much time is left. I don’t care. this needs to keep going, and I don’t care to know when it ends.</li>
	<li>god damn it, real love is gonna kill me isn’t it?

		<ul>
			<li>the raw simplicity of the pre-chorus and chorus feels like a realization of the verses: there’s nothing left to say, and the lack of connection needs no further explanation</li>
			<li>what is done is done, and that is all…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>beautiful synth start to take care, I wonder how my heart will skip now

		<ul>
			<li>jesus christ— “hillsides burning, wild-eyed turning &#39;til we&#39;re running from it” right into the chorus, and the way it ends on “in a year or two” is just… fantastical</li>
			<li>this is a celebration- maybe not of utter success, but of the realization of what two people do and mean to each other; god damn I fucking love this album so much :D</li>
			<li>after silver soul, this is the next closest track in emotional value</li>
			<li>it functionally peaks this pendulum of emotion from the very beginning of the record, and it ends off this chariot ride with a careful trip, directly to the center of your fucking soul</li>
			<li>I love this record, and I will never forget the way it made me feel.</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
