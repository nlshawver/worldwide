<h2>notes for january 20</h2>

<h1>Reflections by Windows96</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Are you sad enough?</h4>

<p>ooh that’s a really well done intro, that driving bass line is really nice :)</p>

<p>and that simple synth melody in between the vocal samples is so relaxing, especially with the warbled bass that stems in ^</p>

<p>feels absolutely transcendent, I love this track and it’s honestly a really good introductory track on a electronic/synthwave record</p>

<h4>Cruising</h4>

<p>and this mf song; the previous track leads so well into this absolute BOP</p>

<p>those synth arpeggios right into this robotic voice and AHHH the DROP :D</p>

<p>god this track is absolutely incredible, every little instrumentation and addition just feels like a such a nice addition</p>

<p>the toned down nature of the ending portion that goes right back into the main instrumental sounds so damn good too, I love it :)</p>

<p>easy five out of five track</p>

<h4>Drive Slow</h4>

<p>I love the cadence of the bass line, and the little beat additions (like the electronic cymbals) mesh really well</p>

<p>I absolutely adore this style of electronic music, that’s so focused on samples and these soaring synth lines- it’s so tied to the individual sounds of the 80’s while being so fresh in its styling</p>

<p>this is another trip, the final ‘chorus’ where the sample ends feels like it’s going to crescendo- but it just dips again, and leaves you with this almost playful synth line</p>

<h4>Kruising</h4>

<p>I was unsure of this sample at first, but the dark aesthetic of the beat when it comes in (especially when the drums and cymbals start complimenting it more, along with the FLUTE) is so well crafted :O</p>

<p>I do like the phrasing of where this is in the record, acting as the polar opposite of Cruising; the instrumentation fits that to a T with that repeating synth line and the simplistic bass line behind it</p>

<h4>Wasted Winds</h4>

<p>another track that grows on me as the beat synthesizes itself; I think some of the instrumentation is a bit too playful, but it fits the aesthetic well when all said and done</p>

<p>ooh and that little beat change right into the crescendo of the track is really damn good :)</p>

<p>synth sax synth sax</p>

<h4>No Future</h4>

<p>damn that bass is powerful :O</p>

<p>that’s a really nice sample with that main synth line; and the strings and diluted horns really add to this aesthetic, this is absolutely lovely :)</p>

<p>and the little marimba ^^</p>

<p>god that sample was actually amazing, might be my second favorite track of the record so far</p>

<h4>Chasing The Sun</h4>

<p>ooh this is already a bop ^</p>

<p>I am a sucker for whatever the hell that incredible synth is; I’m not well-versed in the descriptors used to identify the sound, but it’s the driving synth on this record, it’s wonderful :)</p>

<p>and that little interlude has such a nice soundscape with that perfectly jumpy, emotive synth playing a chord a bar</p>

<p>god and the ending of the track is such a groove</p>

<h4>Sharpest Knives</h4>

<p>oooh that one beat :O</p>

<p>I feel like this is one of those tracks that can get lost in the mix, but the primary synth line is still a treat ^</p>

<p>jesus- the samples on this record are incredible, they hit so well each time especially since the instrumentation that comes after/during each is so good</p>

<h4>Release</h4>

<p>mm I don’t know about that transition, that’s probably my least favorite moment so far :/</p>

<p>but my god if this song isn’t already INSANE wth :O</p>

<p>I absolutely love the crunching drums going along with the bass line, all the while there’s this scratching, grating sort of instrumentation right over the whole thing like a veil</p>

<p>my god that bass re-introduction is so mf good :)</p>

<p>that’s top three on the album for sure ^</p>

<h4>Alone, armed</h4>

<p>much more fitting transition in tone compared to the last time, and-</p>

<p>I am also a sucker for that double-hit bass drum, my lord</p>

<p>and I was a bit lost in the melody, but the short break for the sample right back into this beat is amazing yet again</p>

<h4>Crystal Clear</h4>

<p>OHHH my god that start is amazing :D</p>

<p>damn that beat is a groove and a half, jesus christ</p>

<p>and I love that it’s pretty much a slap sort of styling on that bass line; this track is another masterpiece imo</p>

<h4>Landscaping</h4>

<p>I feel like this is a fitting end to this record’s personality and styling choices, this track feels particularly crafted to fit that mould while still being almost somber</p>
