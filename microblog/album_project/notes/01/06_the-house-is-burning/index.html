<h2>notes for january 6</h2>

<h1>The House Is Burning by Isaiah Rashad</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Darkseid</h4>

<p>alright, good start yet again for these records I’m reviewing, this slow meandering instrumental is nice</p>

<p>that was a very good verse, I love Isaiah’s voice in this because of how smooth it is with that instrumental ^</p>

<p>interesting stop, and a simplistic transition to</p>

<h4>From The Garden (feat. Lil Uzi Vert)</h4>

<p>huh… I don’t know how I feel about that staccato inflection…</p>

<p>or that chorus, even though I think the verse ends pretty well</p>

<p>Uzi’s verse is honestly pretty good though, probably the best part of this song in my opinion</p>

<p>yea I’m just really not a fan of this chorus- but the outro is a high point just because of the energy of it and the recording</p>

<h4>RIP Young</h4>

<p>and that was a very smooth transition, I like that a lot :)</p>

<p>yea this style of song and inflection seems to compliment Isaiah’s voice much more, this is very good</p>

<p>that backing vocal track in the chorus, alongside the very well placed instrumental sounds so damn smooth</p>

<h4>Lay Wit Ya (feat. Duke Deuce)</h4>

<p>damn that is a slick instrumental behind this style of verse, I love it</p>

<p>I don’t think the intentionally lo-fi lyrical tone is usually good, but it fits this track very well</p>

<p>I think Duke Deuce’s feature is not that bad, and it certainly ends on a very high note, but I can’t help but think that Isaiah keeping this feature-less might have complimented the style a lot</p>

<p>either way, still a banger of course ^^</p>

<h4>Claymore (feat. Smino)</h4>

<p>ooh, when that verse comes in… that is damn good</p>

<p>this stretch of four songs (including the next, cause I already heard it) is genuinely great :)</p>

<p>Smino fits very very well on this chorus too, just to say; and while the verse I don’t think sticks the landing nearly as well as it started, is still very good in my opinion</p>

<h4>Headshots (4r Da Locals)</h4>

<p>god this song is so fantastic; that chorus alone just feels so smooth, it’s incredible- but the verses just add to the energy, and fit so well in the mix</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I got a crib bigger than Budapest<br/>And the shots ain’t bringin’ my soldier back</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that is a damn good double entendre on ‘shots,’ probably best lyrical part of this song, and the record so far</p>

<h4>All Herb (feat. Amindi)</h4>

<p>I don’t think a lot of these songs are all that profound, especially in terms of lyrics, but the mix of the energy of the tracklist, and the instrumentals being so smooth and well-placed, I can’t help but think that makes up for it</p>

<p>same with this track- it just seems like a personal story that doesn’t necessarily convey directly as well as I would otherwise think, but the lyrics that do land and connect (with me specifically, of course), alongside that beat behind it, it just feels right</p>

<p>but damn that Amindi verse actually fits and meshes so well, I like that a lot :)</p>

<h4>Hey Mista</h4>

<p>such a smooth chorus, my god</p>

<p>I’ll be honest in saying I saw theneedledrop’s review of this, but I don’t see what he means when all of Isaiah’s parts are outshined by the features, or that he’s boring when he is on the track- I think the tracklist so far sort of disproves that, since the chilled parts feel so intentional, and it meshes way better with me then it did with him I guess</p>

<p>and jesus that second verse on this was surprisingly good, with the change in attitude being so punchy</p>

<h4>True Story (feat. Jay Rock &amp; Jay Worthy)</h4>

<p>this first verse is the only verse I can understand what he meant though, it’s just a bit washed out- but I think the chorus with Amindi he </p>

<p>but DAMN yea Jay Rock carried this track, I have to admit; I don’t think that’s a bad thing, and it compliments the attitude of this track well, but I see exactly what he means</p>

<h4>Wat U Sed (feat. Iamdoechii &amp; Kal Banx)</h4>

<p>this is just another smooth track on here, I like the vibe of this too</p>

<p>and I think Iamdoechii does make a statement with her verse, and it does seem clearer than both Isaiah and Kal Banx’s parts on the track, but I like that sort of energy (even if it’s definitely not my favorite track)</p>

<p>it just feels like a nice shift with those playful synths over the beat</p>

<p>and that was a neat outro, I like that :)</p>

<h4>Don’t Shoot</h4>

<p>damn okay, I don’t know- I seem to really like this Memphis style of these powerful &amp; punchy beats with these slightly washed-out, mellow lyrical flows</p>

<p>it’s simplistic and smooth, and just a style I really like- especially with this track</p>

<h4>Chad (feat. YGTUT)</h4>

<p>okay I was doubting this track at first but damn, this might be the third favorite right now- the beat is so damn smooth, and I love the lyrics, with verses trading back and forth in the mid-section between Isaiah and YGTUT</p>

<p>and while I think I’d like to see more of YGTUT on this, I think that just compliments the style of the song as a whole, and isn’t a dig on Isaiah at all (the reason I like it is because they’re both there, not one or the other; which I think is one way a feature can work really well)</p>

<h4>9-3 Freestyle</h4>

<p>not much I feel drawn to in this track, just seems to be a neat interlude</p>

<p>and some of the bars that are in this are more energetic on the last couple tracks, so I think it’s a bit more of an energetic song on purpose</p>

<h4>Score (feat. SZA &amp; 6LACK)</h4>

<p>okay this might not be one that sticks out to me much, but I do really like the energy of this track, especially this slower part of this first verse:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>War scars and more shit<br/>You got some baggage, emotions<br/>Crash and control issues<br/>Lagging and loading<br/>Heart was too open<br/>I put that over peace</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love that piece, especially when SZA’s part is soon after the chorus- I like this :)</p>

<p>and 6LACK’s part was actually pleasantly surprising, I like how he fits into this track- didn’t think it’d work as well as it did</p>

<h4>THIB</h4>

<p>alright, even though I’m not as much of a fan of the instrumental of this, I do really like the personality of the vocals, and how it pertains to Isaiah’s struggles; I think it’s pretty well made, for sure</p>

<p>and the chorus definitely fits, feels natural almost</p>

<p>that was a harsh beat change, but I’ll let it slide given the themes of this track, and how well</p>

<h4>HB2U</h4>

<p>it transitions into this track- very nice :)</p>

<p>I think the five song grouping from RIP Young to All Herb is first only against these last two tracks- I really like this exit on the record</p>

<p>it’s not terribly unique compared to the rest of this record’s style, but I don’t care, it sounds good; and I like how clear Isaiah’s vocals are after he talks about his problems with alcoholism- that’s such a good thematic focal point, especially as this record fades out</p>

<p>but of course right when I say that there’s this sad and drawn-out conclusion to the whole album:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I should just pack up my bags and get loaded<br/>She sick and tired of distance, I’m a ghost<br/>This ain’t the time of my life, but I’m still on drugs<br/>Just had a weekend buzz<br/>Have I been cheatin’ myself? I’m implodin’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>jesus, and after such a long piece, it’s just over– that is a well made ending in my eyes</p>
