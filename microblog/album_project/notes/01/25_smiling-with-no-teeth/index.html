<h2>notes for january 25</h2>

<h1>Smiling With No Teeth by Genesis Owusu</h1>

<hr />

<h4>On the Move!</h4>

<p>this is such a chaotic, overdriven introductory piece and I really like the aesthetic :O</p>

<p>especially the spacial sort of vocal melody at the ending of it, and it’s genuinely a good tonal beginning</p>

<h4>The Other Black Dog</h4>

<p>ooh I love the playful, clearly smiling sort of lyrical intonation :)</p>

<p>god this is such an infectious beat with this marching aesthetic at the chorus</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s how the story will go<br/>The dog with the blackest of bones<br/>It rides on the back of my clothes<br/>And flocks with a murder like crows</p>
</blockquote>

<p>what a great set of bars, I love the multi-syllabic ending in the context of this whole track</p>

<p>and that’s a nice ending too :)</p>

<h4>Centrefold</h4>

<p>woah, I like the synth instrumental, that’s a really well set tonality</p>

<p>it’s a weird sample with the backwards vocals, but it slides right into the chorus really well, and I think especially with how mellow and smooth the rest of this track is, it’s a great choice :)</p>

<p>so damn nice, I love this track ^</p>

<h4>Waitin’ On Ya</h4>

<p>ah I love that introduction, and jesus when the first real verse kicks in the styling of his vocals is so infectious :D</p>

<p>it’s such a beautiful track, and the cadence of the outro just adds to the fading aesthetic shown off</p>

<p>favorite track so far, and I like how it’s a bit more mellow than the last two tracks, it’s a nice progression ^</p>

<h4>Don’t Need You</h4>

<p>damn, and this is another fantastic shift, all of these hooks and choruses to this point are absolutely wonderful :)</p>

<p>okay that second verse is stupid, wth</p>

<h4>Drown (feat. Kiri J Callinan)</h4>

<p>I was a bit put off from the introduction of this track at first, and the verses don’t really help since I’m not a huge fan of them- but the cohesion of the track is all there</p>

<p>and the fourth verse with Ansah’s vocals—into the chorus—is the peak of this, I really like that at least ^</p>

<h4>Gold Chains</h4>

<p>okay this song is already an incredible track especially in the context of this record, and the first verse and chorus combo is great- but this line:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sleep in sessions, curse or blessings, need refreshing<br/>See progression &#39;cause I beat depression<br/>They throwing pills like M&amp;M&#39;s and I&#39;m hoping they don&#39;t relapse<br/>On stage, the crowd yelling, don&#39;t get lost in feedback</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that is the peak with the cadence and the flow of the verse as a whole; stunning :O</p>

<p>this whole track is lovely though of course, the combination of crazed and stable instrumentation, and Ansah’s voice over the whole thing is just a trip</p>

<h4>Smiling With No Teeth</h4>

<p>jesus and what a follow-up track, the slow, sluggish instrumental with these transcendent vocal lines and occasional spoken-word breaks— this track is a wonder :D</p>

<p>all of the backing vocals just come together in this wonderful sort of way, I’m genuinely just concerned for the remainder of this record because of how seemingly perfect these first eight tracks have been ^^</p>

<h4>I Don’t See Colour</h4>

<p>okay I see this as an absolutely crushing transition- the album felt complete in its thematic choices, right until you get this forceful commentary on overall hypocrisy relating to public perception of race</p>

<h4>Black Dogs</h4>

<p>and the follow-up just feels like an outburst of pure anger, which is so fitting after the last track</p>

<p>I love the styling of the whole album, but this recent transition is wonderfully shocking and absolutely necessary to this record’s personality now ^^</p>

<h4>Whip Cracker</h4>

<p>despite the minimal instrumental, Ansah’s vocals and intonation absolutely hold up and provide a great build-up to this sickeningly groovy beat :)</p>

<p>I think the finality of the track is complete by the first eight bars of that sole instrumental, but the quality of it and the way it morphs afterwards through to the end is valuable and just sounds so lovely ^^</p>

<h4>Easy</h4>

<p>it honestly seems like the instrumental led up to this as a sort of palate cleanser, providing back more of a romantic, love-themed track as a result of it</p>

<p>jesus nevermind there’s still a lot of complicated, layered meaning to this track and it’s definitely not romantic- I apologize for that misinterpretation, I was going for the tone of it (but even that changed by the end)</p>

<h4>A Song About Fishing</h4>

<p>this track feels simple, but I love the return to focus on himself as an individual- and everything just sounds lovely altogether, especially that chorus</p>

<h4>No Looking Back</h4>

<p>god these two back to back are so good, I’m unsure how to even describe the feelings of them together</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And everywhere that I go, all the scars on my skin<br/>I tell myself that, there&#39;s no looking back<br/>I lost the light in those years, locked myself in those tears<br/>And I know that there&#39;s no looking back</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that’s a good way ^</p>

<p>AHHH THE TRUMPET AND SAX :D</p>

<p>this ending to the record so far is absolutely lovely, so damn well made</p>

<h4>Bye Bye</h4>

<p>I appreciate and absolutely love the introspection of this track, this is a wonderful start to a wonderful end :O</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I closed my eyes to disease<br/>Convinced myself I don&#39;t mind<br/>A rolling stone of hidden pleas balled into a landmine<br/>I saw a picture long ago<br/>The smile has turned to rust<br/>Told myself I won&#39;t explode with a molotov in my cup</p>
</blockquote>

<p>what an incredible verse…</p>

<p>and JESUS I love the ending vocals over the impressively sultry beat- with those warbled synths and crushed down bass ^^^</p>

<p>this album is a treat, absolutely lovely :)</p>
