<h2>notes for january 28</h2>

<h1>Motherâ€™s Milk by Red Hot Chili Peppers</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Good Time Boys</h4>

<p>I was initially a bit put off by that introductory instrumental and the aesthetic, but it got surprisingly good as the track built itself up, I like the groove</p>

<p>DAMN that switch-up around the middle caught me off guard, that was rly good :O</p>

<h4>Higher Ground</h4>

<p>okay you know this too; I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything else to say about this track, it&#39;s just a very well made, perfectly different cover :)</p>

<p>rightfully damn catchy tho, I love it ^^</p>

<h4>Subway to Venus</h4>

<p>was not expecting the horns :O</p>

<p>okay I don&#39;t know how to feel about this track; I love the different time signature at times, the horns and choruses are catchy and well-made, but the verses just put me on the wrong foot :/</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s generally a pretty good track tho, and worth it both on its own and in the tracklist</p>

<h4>Magic Johnson</h4>

<p>what the hell is this lmao</p>

<p>okay somehow that was well-rounded by the end- the chorus was perfectly catchy, and the topic is ridiculous enough to support the weight of the instrumental :)</p>

<h4>Nobody Weird Like Me</h4>

<p>AHHHH THAT BASS LINE IS ICONIC</p>

<p>I forgot about this track, this is wonderful :D</p>

<p>I do think the structure is very thin, but it suits the attitude well I think- and my god that bridge to outro is perfectly warbled and completely out there</p>

<h4>Knock Me Down</h4>

<p>what?</p>

<p>this track just kinda came out of nowhere, the meaning and expressiveness of that was much better than I expected in all honesty</p>

<p>but why is there a key change :c</p>

<h4>Taste the Pain</h4>

<p>ooh the atmosphere and instrumental for this is really well made- I think it ends stronger than it starts, but that&#39;s a really well rounded track :O</p>

<h4>Stone Cold Bush</h4>

<p>interesting start... idk about this one so far</p>

<p>yea wasn&#39;t a huge fan of that- the verses and small bridge/interludes are well made, but the chorus just sounds so grating and not in a charming way :/</p>

<h4>Fire</h4>

<p>okay as far as covers go this is pretty good, but some moments, like the chorus after the intro puts me off a bit- the instrumentation is really well done, my only critique is really just that chorus line</p>

<h4>Pretty Little Ditty</h4>

<p>classic introduction instrumental, I&#39;m liking this :)</p>

<p>oh it&#39;s just an interlude? r.i.p.</p>

<h4>Punk Rock Classic</h4>

<p>HAHAHAHA I wrote this one off almost instantly, but jesus christ if that outro lick isn&#39;t the funniest thing on this record lmao</p>

<p>that&#39;s all, that&#39;s the worth of this track to me ^</p>

<h4>Sexy Mexican Maid</h4>

<p>okay despite the stupid and ridiculous name of this song, this is surprising in how smooth the instruments work together, it&#39;s almost charmingly well done</p>

<p>that guitar solo is a bit off, but it is at the very least skillful, and it&#39;s a nice sort of thematic break</p>

<p>bruh the verse after &gt;.&gt;</p>

<h4>Johnny, Kick a Hole in the Sky</h4>

<p>okay this is not bad, I think the verses are personable and are the right amount of funky- so honestly just an overall good ending to an alright album :)</p>
