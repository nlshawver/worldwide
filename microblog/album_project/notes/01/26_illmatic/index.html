<h2>notes for january 26</h2>

<h1>Illmatic by Nas</h1>

<hr />

<h4>The Genesis</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>True indeed, knamsayin&#39;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is such a thematically interesting introduction, and gives a peek into this conversational style, right before…</p>

<h4>N.Y. State of Mind</h4>

<p>this track is an absolute treat, and a bonafide masterpiece</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never sleep, &#39;cause sleep is the cousin of death<br/>Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined</p>
</blockquote>

<p>iconic :O</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thinkin&#39; of cash flow, Buddha and shelter<br/>Whenever frustrated, I&#39;ma hijack Delta</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the depth of just those two lines alone is insane, please just look through this entire genius page; it is absolutely worth it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I got so many rhymes, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m too sane<br/>Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can’t really say much more, this is a lyrical master class, and such a guttural introduction into this era and scene of hip hop</p>

<h4>Life’s a Bitch (feat. AZ)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Keepin&#39; this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us<br/>&#39;Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I need to stop putting in lyrics, but so so many of these bars are both layered with insane attention to detail, and are just drenched in a swagger and swiftness that’s so incredibly infectious</p>

<p>I could put Nas’s whole verse here if I had to put all lyrics that impressed me, jesus christ :O</p>

<p>okay now is the time I actually talk about the instrumental, because honestly the minimalism of it is exactly what compliments the lyricists- and my god that muted trumpet done by Nas’s father Olu Dara is a wonderful sendoff :)</p>

<h4>The World is Yours</h4>

<p>I think of the two real tracks we’ve seen so far, this has the most technically impressive and lovely instrumental, it feels so funky and so pleasantly classical in its styling- thank you Pete Rock</p>

<p>okay back to Nas:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he&#39;ll lead in right direction<br/>How you livin&#39;? Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?<br/>You flippin&#39; coke or playin&#39; spit, spades, and strip poker?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and of course:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the knowledge and artistry this man has is wonderfully shocking :D</p>

<h4>Halftime</h4>

<p>thank u large professor</p>

<p>but you have to adore that boom bap instrumental, the deep bass line and drums under it—with horns at certain interludes—it’s amazing</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But chill, pass to Andre, and let&#39;s slay<br/>I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinée</p>
</blockquote>

<p>good idea lol</p>

<p>just overall a great track, I love the style changes this record brings in the instrumentals</p>

<h4>Memory Lane (Sittin’ in da Park)</h4>

<p>case in point with DJ Premier helping on this; those rhodes-esque keys give such an interesting aesthetic to the track, and the record scratching with the sampled chorus is just a testament to this old, skillful style :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My pen taps the paper, then my brain&#39;s blank<br/>I see dark streets, hustlin&#39; brothers who keep the same rank<br/>Pumpin&#39; for somethin&#39;, some&#39;ll prosper, some fail</p>
</blockquote>

<p>just want to point out one of many inter-bar, inter-verse, mid line rhymes with “hustlin’ brothers” and “some’ll prosper”</p>

<p>this record is insane</p>

<h4>One Love</h4>

<p>god that entire first verse is another treat in itself, I love it :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack<br/>Mind&#39;s in another world, thinkin&#39;<br/>&quot;How can we exist through the facts?&quot;<br/>Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera<br/>Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it was always on the mind; that’s such a transcendent start to the third verse :O</p>

<p>I just want to compliment the instrumental, for some reason that music box sort of melody as the main instrument is surprisingly endearing</p>

<h4>One Time 4 Your Mind</h4>

<p>this was the weakest instrumental for me until I heard that bass line, this is up there with the rest of them; it’s so damn good</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I try to stay mellow, rock, well, a cappella rhymes&#39;ll<br/>Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this line was both playful and meaningless, but just so well-articulated and it fit so well into the context of this track; incredible :D</p>

<h4>Represent</h4>

<p>another earworm instrumental, such a great, powerful energy with a simplistic, creepily weird aesthetic</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for<br/>The fronters, wannabe ill n––s and spot runners<br/>Thinking it can&#39;t happen &#39;til I trap &#39;em and clap &#39;em<br/>And leave &#39;em done, won&#39;t even run about gods<br/>I don&#39;t believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ya know I think this guy is good at rhyming and constructing lyrical poetry</p>

<h4>It Ain’t Hard to Tell</h4>

<p>DUDE COME ON- what the absolute hell is this instrumental, this is INSANE</p>

<p>okay that entire first verse is stunning, but what a sendoff:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell<br/>From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain&#39;t hard to tell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>actually, thinking about it, all of these verses are stunning :O</p>

<p>I don’t care, I just don’t care what anyone thinks- this is the best song of the 90’s; it’s such a microcosm of all of what New York, African-American/black, hip hop, and come-up sort of culture was, and it’s so effortlessly clean yet brutally honest and crushing</p>

<p>what a mf treat, my god</p>
