<h2>notes for january 11</h2>

<h1>Norman Fucking Rockwell! by Lana Del Rey</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Norman fucking Rockwell!</h4>

<p>woah, I was not expecting this… the piano under these vocals is pretty stunning</p>

<p>that verse two has a surprising amount of meaning behind, I like this so far ^</p>

<p>and jesus her voice is soaring before it fades into muddiness behind the instrumental</p>

<p>that’s not at all what I was expecting but it delivered, that’s good</p>

<h4>Mariners Apartment Complex</h4>

<p>a very subtle instrumental, and while I was doubting in the first verse, that pre-chorus caught me again and was surprisingly emotive</p>

<p>and the chorus to follow it up is very good too, I’m just really not a big fan of the instrumental with the instrument choice- even if the actual harmony and melody made by them are good</p>

<p>the ending synths for me kinda pick this up, especially with the dreamy vocals- that is a very nicely composed ending imo</p>

<h4>Venice Bitch</h4>

<p>wow, this starts really well, and the post-chorus sticks out to me most; while this is not something I’d listen to often, this seems to be one of the best and well-made examples of this genre</p>

<p>ohh I’m really not a fan of those drums… just reminds me of a modern church :(</p>

<p>the rest of the instrumentation is really sweet and mellow, which is the part that makes me the saddest, cause I just really didn’t mesh with that beat change; when it comes in again quietly though it is much better tho</p>

<p>around this crazy guitar solo and the acoustic guitar going nuts with the chords; I love the chaos that turns into really well-fitting melodic pieces</p>

<p>okay the second beat change when it gets the most intense this record has gotten to yet is really well done, I have to say… and that comes down really quickly from that chaos, pretty big tonal shift but it’s executed well</p>

<p>and I guess it’s a compliment that that didn’t feel like nine and a half minutes at all</p>

<p><strong>okay revision on second listen- those drums are not that bad, that was kind of overblown given how it actually fits pretty well (and also this is my third favorite now)</strong></p>

<h4>Fuck it I love you</h4>

<p>staying this low and mellow I think is the only good way to move away from Venice Bitch, so good start in addition to a good verse and very good pre-chorus/chorus combination :)</p>

<p>okay the cadence on the chorus is really getting to me with how high her voice can get without feeling shrill, this is my favorite track so far ^</p>

<p>wow and I haven’t complimented her songwriting ability as much as I should’ve, that bridge was powerful when it goes right back into the chorus </p>

<h4>Doin’ Time</h4>

<p>ohhhh okay I know this- oh my god this mf instrumental slaps :O</p>

<p>AHHH THAT BEAT DROP, that was genuinely such a jaw-dropping moment on this record</p>

<p>god damn this thing is so smooth, expressive, and just pretty soulful especially compared to what I thought of the opening of this record</p>

<p>and the beat just keeps getting better, those small details between the bridge and final chorus are stunning even if they’re so subtle</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evil, we&#39;ve come to tell you that she&#39;s evil, most definitely<br/>Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely</p>
</blockquote>

<p>jesus that kinda got me, that’s a damn good line in a five out of five track; I eat my ‘new favorite’ words from just a few minutes ago</p>

<h4>Love song</h4>

<p>okay especially with this come down romance track after Doin’ Time gives me a kind of new perspective on this thing, it doesn’t have to be all that exciting and these slow melodies are soothing and it makes the notable moments more momentous</p>

<p>that chorus was really good, and it just ends so smoothly right into the next verse- which is stunning, I might add</p>

<p>god the strings in this last chorus and outro are like a drop-to-your-knees kind of moment- and it’s powerful and moving without needing at all to be bombastic</p>

<h4>Cinnamon Girl</h4>

<p>oooh that drop into the chorus with that rumbling bass line- and the SYNTH right after that’s just sneaking in is so smooth</p>

<p>and dude… this chorus and post-chorus is beautiful, I’m so glad it comes back to it again and ends on this somber tonality over a stunning instrumental</p>

<p>and while I think I’d normally think that the outro drags on, appreciating it as almost an interlude and enjoying this very well-made instrumental is a gift to my ears</p>

<h4>How to disappear</h4>

<p>yea her voice is stunning, whatever</p>

<p>this is another really good instrumental; not as special yet as what the past few tracks have been to me but, especially with sleigh bell aesthetic it changes up really well ^</p>

<p>and again, the actual vocals are so stunning without being drawn-out or anything close to too dramatic</p>

<p>idk why so many songs have great outros to me, but that’s another good one</p>

<h4>California</h4>

<p>I really love the careful desperation on the chorus, it’s genuinely amazing with the instrumentals almost leading this along</p>

<p>and I think that second verse through to pre-chorus and chorus is my favorite patch of this song, it’s such a good peak ^</p>

<p>that was a sort abrupt ending, but it transitions into the next song really well I think:</p>

<h4>The Next Best American Record</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>My baby used to dance underneath my architecture<br/>To the Houses of the Holy, smokin&#39; on them cigarettes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>okay that is really damn good, I love those two lines together in the first short verse</p>

<p>WOAH that chorus caught me off guard, that is so damn good :O</p>

<p>I am just taken aback by how much of an emotional change this record put me through, I was not expecting this sort of energy at ALL</p>

<h4>The greatest</h4>

<p>okay the verse was the main part that stuck out to me, but seriously this guitar solo after the chorus was another great moment since it just happens right before Lana’s voice again</p>

<p>and I just love how extremely nostalgic this track is, it’s hyper-focused and very well-done imo</p>

<blockquote>
<p>L.A. is in flames‚ it&#39;s getting hot<br/>Kanye West is blond and gone<br/>&quot;Life on Mars?&quot; ain&#39;t just a song<br/>I hope the live stream&#39;s almost on</p>
</blockquote>

<p>jesus… that is a great outro with these keys backing up the fade out</p>

<h4>Bartender</h4>

<p>ooh… the static around her vocals is an interesting choice(?), but that long chorus is a very good pick in my eyes since this track is almost entirely her incredible vocals and this smooth piano melody</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought me a truck in the middle of the night<br/>It&#39;ll buy me a year if I play my cards right<br/>Photo-free exits from baby&#39;s bedside<br/>&#39;Cause they don&#39;t yet know what car I drive</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and this is a very good start to that chorus, with that nice double entendre ^</p>

<h4>Happiness is a butterfly</h4>

<p>that was probably the best tonal transition in the record- mainly cause these start off so similar, but still</p>

<p>and wow that is a shocking pre-chorus that delivers so well into the chorus :O</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley<br/>I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the way she vocalizes that, and the split vocals on the post-chorus… oooh</p>

<p>and that is a really slick ending, I like that a lot too</p>

<h4>hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but I have it</h4>

<p>I do really like the fact that these ending tracks have been almost solely her vocals and just these nice piano melodies to go along with it</p>

<p>also it might be placebo but I seriously think her songwriting just gets better as the record goes along, it’s so damn good</p>

<p>and jesus that is possibly the most emotive chorus this whole record; the bridge right after is just as good, and I’m just now realizing there’s two choruses that rhyme and intersect with each other, and I absolutely love that</p>

<p>my god, best outro by far with her vocality</p>
