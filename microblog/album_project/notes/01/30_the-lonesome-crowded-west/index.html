<h2>notes for january 30</h2>

<h1>The Lonesome Crowded West by Modest Mouse</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Teeth Like God’s Shoeshine</h4>

<p>wow okay, I was not expecting that introduction to this record—</p>

<p>yea that first chorus and verse is an absolute trip, and then it tones itself down into the midpoint of the song</p>

<p>I’m so taken aback from this tbh, it’s so much different than what I was expecting- WOAH that chorus/bridge transition and the guitar work is absolutely stunning :O</p>

<p>yea that breakdown in the final minute is unabashedly crushing, I love this opener</p>

<h4>Heart Cooks Brain</h4>

<p>and somehow it gets better- I love the simple, stuttering drum beat and the reverse record scratching in between all of the complex, intertwined vocal lines</p>

<p>all of the instrumentation works together so well, and I’m surprised by how much I like Brock’s raw and incongruent vocal lines</p>

<h4>Convenient Parking</h4>

<p>god it’s like this song is meant for me- I adore the breakdown into the chorus all about suburban sprawl and the razing of all nature for the sake of ‘convenience’</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soon the chain reaction started in the parking lot<br/>Waiting to bleed onto the big streets<br/>That bleed out onto the highways<br/>And off to others cities built to store and sell these rocks<br/>Well, aren&#39;t you feeling real dirty sitting in the parking lot?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think this track is all that standout any longer necessarily, but given this came our over twenty years ago, this holds a surprisingly significant place in my brain now :)</p>

<h4>Lounge (Closing Time)</h4>

<p>oh my god I adore this instrumental, it feels so special and like such a groove- and while the layered vocals are somewhat grating, it fits so well to my ears :O</p>

<p>yea just even more of a great transition to the midpoint and instrumental break of this song, with that cadence of the drum section- this is fantastic :D</p>

<p>I like that lyrical callback too ^^</p>

<h4>Jesus Christ Was an Only Child</h4>

<p>what is this</p>

<p>okay how is that violin actually such a groove-</p>

<p>I do like the meaning behind this track, but it’s hard for me to feel connected to the track given its seemingly random placement in terms of theme and styling</p>

<h4>Doin’ the Cockroach</h4>

<p>yea we’re right back into the normal aesthetic of the record (which I’m not complaining about, I just don’t know)</p>

<p>oh my god those vocals are so biting, that’s genuinely so damn good with this chaotic, driving instrumental :O</p>

<h4>Cowboy Dan</h4>

<p>I have no idea why or how, but that first verse genuinely shocked me, I’m not sure why this is connecting so m- oh it’s because I’m from the midwest, that’s right</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Standing in the tall grass<br/>Thinking nothing<br/>You know we need oxygen to breathe<br/>Oxygen to breathe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>damn, and this subtle breakdown to these more painfully somber vocals are absolutely wonderful</p>

<p>this might be my favorite track so far, I’m not really sure</p>

<h4>Trailer Trash</h4>

<p>this is surprisingly introspective, and I love the harmonic guitar playing- this genuinely a great transition from the last track, and I can understand why this is one of the most popular tracks of this record</p>

<p>jesus the instrumental breakdowns are so lovingly crafted and incredibly well-done ^^</p>

<h4>Out of Gas</h4>

<p>I don’t really have much to comment on this one, it’s a very minimal, lovely interlude sort of track :)</p>

<p>I keep finding more places and more tracks to appreciate Brock’s vocals, and this is another one of them</p>

<h4>Long Distance Drunk</h4>

<p>I really like the (excuse me) drunk sounding combination of instrumentation over these very mellow vocals- it’s a very suiting aesthetic, and I absolutely love it :)</p>

<h4>Shit Luck</h4>

<p>and we’re right back into these screeching, painful guitar wails, holy hell :O</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This plane is definitely crashing<br/>This boat is obviously sinking<br/>This building&#39;s totally burning down</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know why but screaming these lines is both incredibly funny and so dark at the same time</p>

<p>the combination is just shocking, and I love it ^^</p>

<h4>Truckers Atlas</h4>

<p>god that instrumental—especially the drum beat—is wonderfully infectious :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m going to Colorado to unload my head<br/>I&#39;m going to New York City and that&#39;s in New York, friends<br/>I&#39;m going up to Alaska, I&#39;m gonna get off scot-fucking-free<br/>And we all did</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love that opener, the whole energy of this track is such a great moment for me so far ^^</p>

<p>and while I think for sure this outro instrumental drags on, I do really like that slow build up with increasing levels of chaos and punchiness in especially the drums- and then it just fades out :O</p>

<h4>Polar Opposites</h4>

<p>jesus that chorus… absolutely heart-wrenching, and it’s done in such a visceral, real method of articulation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m tryin&#39;, I&#39;m tryin&#39; to<br/>Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away</p>
</blockquote>

<p>okay this is my second favorite track, the minimalism and sheer emotion are really well done to my ears (and brain)</p>

<h4>Bankrupt on Selling</h4>

<p>this is another heartfelt track, like the rest of the record in all honesty</p>

<p>seriously this album just encapsulates the inescapability of the modern world, especially the hell that is american suburbia; the message behind this album is very, very well made</p>

<h4>Styrofoam Boots/It’s All Nice On Ice, Alright</h4>

<p>okay I wasn’t sold on this track for a little while, but that backing track once that insane drum beat comes in is legitimately outstanding, I love that sharp energy change, and the intensity on the drums being at the forefront of the track</p>

<p>especially when it keeps increasing in tempo up until it starts fading and then- done :O</p>

<p>wonderful end to a fantastic record :)</p>
