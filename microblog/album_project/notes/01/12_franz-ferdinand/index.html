<h2>notes for january 12</h2>

<h1>self-titled by Franz Ferdinand</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Jacqueline</h4>

<p>what a bombastic, hedonistic introduction to this record :O</p>

<p>and that’s such a shredding, vibrant verse into this second chorus; both of these instrumental breaks are incredible</p>

<h4>Tell Her Tonight</h4>

<p>what a quick transition into this completely different and slick track, I love the choice of instruments, and just how shockingly well these tracks work in being so colorful (despite the lo-fi mastering)</p>

<p>great starting two tracks, but…</p>

<h4>Take Me Out</h4>

<p>come on dude— how does this song even exist</p>

<p>you just know from the intro vocals this is gonna be great, and the guitar line is magnificent… but then you get the punchy and groovy break into the first verse that still stuns eighteen years later</p>

<p>also I had no idea: this song released on the twelfth of january 2004- <em>exactly</em> eighteen years ago</p>

<p>I just have to compliment, that while of course the drums and bass are what make most of this beat (outside of the primary guitar melody), those backing guitar lines are masterful</p>

<p>masterpiece of a track :D</p>

<h4>The Dark of the Matinée</h4>

<p>and surprisingly, the next track somehow lives up to that last one- maybe not in legacy and recognizability, but seriously this track is the best ‘deep cut’ on the record</p>

<p>the backing guitar is yet again a fantastic addition, but seriously: these vocals and bass line are so satisfying to bob your head along to :)</p>

<p>and god that bridge is so playful up until the last few lines, where it feels almost menacing before flashing back into the chorus :O</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You will find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files<br/>You must follow, leave this academic factory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is the best line so far, feels so natural ^</p>

<h4>Auf Achse</h4>

<p>that’s a very groovy introduction; the instrumentals are seriously so well-made and generally stand out to me so far</p>

<p>this is just a well-made post-punk sort of track, which of couse means its so infectiously catchy</p>

<p>a very well done bridge and outro to go alone with that too, that was honestly slightly surprising- and in a very good way ^</p>

<h4>Cheating on You</h4>

<p>ooh, that’s a very fiery introduction, and that guitar riff is infectious :O</p>

<p>I think the production is pretty muddy, but given how intense this song is I don’t even blame it; and that chorus and especially the outro is delivered so intensely</p>

<p>great track honestly, that’s an actual quality deep cut</p>

<h4>This Fire</h4>

<p>yet another great set-up to these weird, discordant &amp; layered vocals- I think that chorus is the only weak part because this beat is absolutely fire (yes intended)</p>

<p>okay on further examination, this track is insane- such a 2000’s style banger that hits pretty much everything right</p>

<p>that slow reintroduction of all the instruments hits SO well</p>

<p>is this alternative rock playboi carti?</p>

<h4>Darts of Pleasure</h4>

<p>ooh that is an incredibly stylish, smooth introduction and first verse</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are the latest contender<br/>You are the one to remember<br/>You are the villain who sends a<br/>Line of dark fantastic passion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that just sounds so good coming from Alex Kapranos; and AH that stutter :)</p>

<p>and oh my god that german outro sounds so smooth coming from a scottish band lmao </p>

<h4>Michael</h4>

<p>another stunning guitar riff, and that bass line is not bad at all ^</p>

<p>this one honestly might be my least favorite so far, but it’s still pretty good- and that outro kinda ties it together for me and it just shined at that point</p>

<h4>Come on Home</h4>

<p>OOOH that intro is so damn well made, so groovy and I just love the vocal lines:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although my lover lives in a place that I can&#39;t live<br/>I kind of find I like a life this lonely<br/>It rips and pierces me in places I can&#39;t see<br/>I love the rip of nerves, the rip that wakes me<br/>So I&#39;m dissatisfied, I love dissatisfied<br/>I love to feel as though it&#39;s more than I need</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there’s so many stunning tracks on this record that aren’t even close to as popular as their others, and this is one of them for sure ^</p>

<p>jesus that guitar :O</p>

<p>honestly surprised by that outro, I really like how somber is gets compared to the rest of the track</p>

<h4>40’</h4>

<p>oh my god, that quiet plucking just feels so good, and it grows into this amazing combination; this is such a fantastic track so far</p>

<p>gotta love the reverb on the guitar, that’s such a good fit with the vibe- and great vocals as always :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Salt scales upon my drying arms<br/>Burn my back beneath the sun<br/>But I am cold beneath the burning rays<br/>Looking down, looking down, down, down again</p>
</blockquote>

<p>outside of “oh forty feet remain” that is a great verse to end on</p>

<p>and OH MY GOD this ending instrumental break is absolutely crushing; that sting to end is a perfect end to dare I say the most succinct indie rock album I have heard</p>
