<h2>notes for january 10</h2>

<h1>Immunity by Clairo</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Alewife</h4>

<p>alright, some chill chords and a drowned out sort of aesthetic, I like this pretty well, especially as an opener</p>

<p>I really like the layered and echoed vocals, it’s a nice little soundscape</p>

<p>and that’s a great second verse, it’s so personable and introspective</p>

<p>ooh, and I like that incredibly blown out harmony you get after that outro/third verse, along with that synth melody- kind of distracting but perfectly vibrant</p>

<h4>Impossible</h4>

<p>nice instrumental to start this off with that bass line</p>

<p>I do kind of agree that her vocals sound like what beige would sound like, but it honestly seems like a thematic fit for me</p>

<p>that’s a really nice chorus though, I like that a lot; and that’s a good bridge too, especially with the vocal change to Danielle Haim for a bit</p>

<p>always a sucker for these outros, they sound so pleasant :)</p>

<h4>Closer to You</h4>

<p>woah okay, not what I was expected- and that’s some very good bass</p>

<p>hmm, not sure how I feel about that T-Pain style autotune</p>

<p>damn but those pre-chorus lines right into the harmonic synths and strings in the chorus are all a nice combination</p>

<p>oh shit okay, I know using genius is kinda basic, but the thematic reason for the autotune is very compelling, especially when the chorus is devoid of it</p>

<p>a bit more appreciation for this track now, and that chorus does sound so damn good; very nice ending harmony too ^</p>

<h4>North</h4>

<p>okay I already really like this track, this sounds harsh and smooth at the exact same time (which very much fits the energy of the vocal lines)</p>

<p>that chorus is very, very noticeably blown out, and while I could criticize that part it just seems to fit relatively well imo</p>

<p>ohhh and that bridge to the chorus again sounds so good :)</p>

<p>and I always love a fade-out ending</p>

<h4>Bags</h4>

<p>ooh, that’s a pretty good chorus, but that beat change at the chorus, then the added synth at the second half of it just sound so good; and I always love a very lo-fi piano ^</p>

<p>and the slight increase in energy in the second verse is a good fit too, this is an indie pop banger imo</p>

<p>that is a damn good bridge, I love that a lot- and such a great chorus right after :D</p>

<h4>Softly</h4>

<p>mm, I like the beat and all of this one, but it doesn’t seem to land with me as well as the first half of this record has; I’m just not big about the chorus</p>

<p>very nice vibe though, just a bit of a dip for me so far</p>

<h4>Sofia</h4>

<p>okay so far this is coming back from that dip really well, that’s a very solid intro and first chorus (even if I’m not a huge fan of the chorus being the first part)</p>

<p>this is a banger already, and the chorus starting off maybe wasn’t so bad with how good that second one is… but why is it so blown out, I’m really not liking that much</p>

<p>like yea it’s unique, but it just does not mesh with me too well rn; and the rest of the song sounds so damn good, that sucks :/</p>

<h4>White Flag</h4>

<p>ooh and this is a very nice verse, I like this build-up a lot</p>

<p>AHH that caught me off guard hard, that shit is delicious</p>

<p>and god the second verse having the same energy as that chorus just makes it feel off-kilter, fitting the vibe so damn well</p>

<p>I love this, that’s my favorite so far, with both Bags and Impossible being tied for second rn</p>

<h4>Feel Something</h4>

<p>I feel like that was just pretty good- it might stand out the least from the other tracks to my ears but there was nothing bad about it; it fits into the album’s progression pretty well</p>

<h4>Sinking</h4>

<p>I like that first verse a lot, especially how it ends ^</p>

<p>ooh, background synths on the chorus sound so expressive, just like the bass line right after it :)</p>

<p>this is very nice track to have on the tail end of this, that’s nice</p>

<h4>I Wouldn’t Ask You</h4>

<p>god that is such a smooth ending to the first verse, I like that a lot with how mellowed out this track is</p>

<p>and now the second verse, this is really well made imo</p>

<p>ooooh that style switch-up… this chorus reminds me almost of an r&amp;b/gospel crossover with that kind of sample, that’s really good</p>

<p>and I feel that second verse, it’s so expressive in this record :)</p>

<p>OOH when there’s heavy bass it is very well-placed :O</p>

<p>that is a very good ending to this record, big four</p>
