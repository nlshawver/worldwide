<h2>notes for january 16</h2>

<h1>OK Computer by Radiohead</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Airbag</h4>

<p>ooh this introduction is really good, I&#39;m liking this so far with very typical vocal styling from Thom</p>

<p>and I really like how warped and alien this instrumental turns into, with the driving guitar following right after it</p>

<h4>Paranoid Android</h4>

<p>god and I love this track so far, with the acoustic guitar section over these more tame vocal sections- but right into this incredibly aggressive bridge</p>

<p>the structure of this song is both mind numbing and completely sensible, I love that</p>

<p>and this second bridge is so unsettling, and in such a good way</p>

<p>god this second instrumental break is crushing, that&#39;s incredible :O</p>

<h4>Subterranean Homesick Alien</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The breath of the morning I keep forgetting<br/>The smell of the warm summer air<br/>I live in a town where you can&#39;t smell a thing<br/>You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that is a really somber start, that sets the mood really damn well</p>

<p>and those rhodes keys are a really great fit :)</p>

<p>jesus that transition back into the second chorus got me good, that&#39;s amazing ^</p>

<h4>Exit Music (For a Film)</h4>

<p>ooh wow, these vocals hit so well; I love it</p>

<p>and with the backing lines that develop behind him, damn ^^</p>

<p>jesus, that&#39;s such a crunchy bass line, that&#39;s incredible with Thom&#39;s vocals :O</p>

<h4>Let Down</h4>

<p>that was a really good transition, I&#39;m loving this record so far :)</p>

<p>the guitar riff that persists throughout this track is really nice, it&#39;s a great continual line through it</p>

<p>god and that beat that sort of just appears out of nowhere with a little over a minute left got to me ^</p>

<p>this felt both hopeful and absolutely crushing at the same time, I love it</p>

<h4>Karma Police</h4>

<p>oh my god, that buzzing bass with the keys throughout the whole track- I don&#39;t even know how to describe this song, it&#39;s just haunting and lackadaisical simultaneously</p>

<p>jesus christ what an outro :O</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know what to think, and I think that&#39;s the point</p>

<h4>Fitter Happier</h4>

<p>this is so unsettling, jesus christ</p>

<p>the theme of this record is getting to me, it&#39;s so hyper-focused on modernity and life as a concept</p>

<h4>Electioneering</h4>

<p>but damn what a fantastic sound on the following track, it feels so foreign after last track :O</p>

<p>I think this is the highlight of this record so far just because of that, it&#39;s such a driving, furious track and I adore it :O</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Riot shields, voodoo economics, your turn, your turn<br/>It&#39;s just business, cattle prods and the I.M.F<br/>I trust I can rely on your vote</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and that verse- my god</p>

<h4>Climbing Up the Walls</h4>

<p>jesus this album is such a trip, everything is just so threatening and terrifying without even being outright aggressive for much if it</p>

<p>this track exemplifies that to a tea</p>

<h4>No Surprises</h4>

<p>what the hell</p>

<p>why is there a glockenspiel :O</p>

<p>okay wait this is actually really good</p>

<p>my god that first verse is genuinely shocking, I adore that sort of contrast given the tone of the track</p>

<p>and that is a lovely outro, probably my second favorite track (or at least second most notable track) in all honesty :)</p>

<h4>Lucky</h4>

<p>my lord, this track is an absolute treat as well :O</p>

<p>all the vocals and instruments fit so well, it&#39;s a lovely combination and tone</p>

<p>yet again another stunning outro too ^</p>

<h4>The Tourist</h4>

<p>yet again another soaring, somber piece of work- I love it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I get overcharged<br/>That&#39;s when you see sparks<br/>They ask me where the hell I&#39;m going<br/>At a thousand feet per second</p>
</blockquote>

<p>god that&#39;s so good, and I love the fit of the overblown guitars right after the following chorus :)</p>

<p>fantastic end to a stunning record ^</p>
