<h2>notes for january 7</h2>

<h1>self-titled by KIDS SEE GHOSTS</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Feel The Love</h4>

<p>Cudi is already incredible, you know it</p>

<p>if I’ll be honest I didn’t know that was Pusha-T on that first verse, but it goes so well with this vibe</p>

<p>and then its just KANYE SCREAMING</p>

<p>I don’t know why this goes hard, but I think it has something to do with the insane instrumental- shit is so </p>

<h4>Fire</h4>

<p>damn you already know this is so good with the instrumentals, all of them on this record are so mf good</p>

<p>a good verse on Kanye’s part goes into an incredible verse by Cudi, and the OUTRO is amazing</p>

<p>it’s marching forward through Cudi’s amazing vocals, it just feels amazing</p>

<p>short and sweet outro, right into one of the craziest songs on the record:</p>

<h4>4th Dimension (feat. Louis Prima)</h4>

<p>great sample that fits this like a glove, right into an incredibly punchy and lyrically lovely verse from Kanye, the metaphors and lyrical tricks are so well done in my eyes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It feels so good, it should cost<br/>Bought a alligator, I ain’t talkin’ Lacoste</p>

<p>She seem to make me always feel like a boss<br/>She said I’m in the wrong hole, I said I’m lost</p>

<p>That’s too new to mention, or fit in a sentence<br/>If I get locked up, I won’t finish the sent—</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and that laughter is ridiculous, and the one part that knocks me out of it for a second, but it’s somehow perfect to go right to Cudi’s verse right after- it’s like a huge contrast despite the instrumental</p>

<p>also damn Cudi’s verse ends so well, especially with that Ric Flair line lol</p>

<p>thank you Shirly Ann Lee :)</p>

<h4>Freeee (Ghost Town Pt.2)</h4>

<p>JESUS CHRIST THIS SONG</p>

<p>this is the best introduction to a song I have ever heard</p>

<p>I don’t even care that the ‘FREEEEEE’ might seem kinda dumb, it just works for me, I love it in this context</p>

<p>and the harmonization towards the end of the verse and the refrain, it feels transcendent</p>

<p>I love you Cudi</p>

<p>dude you can’t tell me this song doesn’t just feel so powerful and that the synths don’t just do wonders with the drum line and vocals</p>

<h4>Reborn</h4>

<p>this was a classic right when it came out; you know it was right when Cudi started humming</p>

<p>the whole song is about bringing up, discussing, and growing from your past mistakes and issues- I just think it’s impossible not to feel moved by this</p>

<p>if you don’t get something from this, pick yourself up man… come on</p>

<p>goosebumps at the end of Kanye’s verse into the chorus again, seriously</p>

<p>I can’t really say much else; each track is just a masterpiece, and this is the best mellow, introspective, and emotional song on the whole record</p>

<p>okay but just want to point out the fantastic bass right into the bridge</p>

<p>beautiful track, five out of five easily</p>

<h4>Kids See Ghosts</h4>

<p>this isn’t even a weak track coming out of Reborn, Cudi’s part is so soulful, I don’t think I can say anything more about how good this is</p>

<p>more incredible sounding basslines, right before a very stand-out verse from Kanye</p>

<p>DAMN the ending of Kanye’s verse is so smooth, I love the final lines:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I won’t relish on the fact I’m vibin’ on the future<br/>Ultralight buildin’ in the buildin’ by Miuccia<br/>Herzog and de Meuron in an office out in Basel<br/>No not Miami, Switzerland</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and wow, I just love Yasiin Bey’s whole part on this record, he’s amazing on this just as well as Kanye and Cudi</p>

<h4>Cudi Montage</h4>

<p>I didn’t think I’d love Cudi rapping as much as I did, this first verse might be the best verse I’ve heard from him since his debut</p>

<p>dude this is the least-fitting verse in the whole record (imo) but it’s still so damn good, I like it so much as well</p>

<p>and this whole outro sounds so powerful, no matter whether you personally relate to the ‘Lord shine your light on me, save me, please’ bars</p>

<p>and just as it begins, it is over in just 24 minutes… this album doesn’t overstate its welcome for a single second</p>
