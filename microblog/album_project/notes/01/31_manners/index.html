<h2>notes for january 31</h2>

<h1>Manners by Passion Pit</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Make Light</h4>

<p>so far I’m not a huge fan of the shimmering, borderline screeching yet in all honesty- but it’s only the opening track</p>

<p>yea, that chorus has a lot more merit, the meshing between the instrumental and Angelakos’s vocals is much better overall than what I hear in the verses (even though the guitar work in general is really well-rounded and interesting)</p>

<p>still not sold on it, but I still have forty-ish minutes to go ^^</p>

<h4>Little Secrets</h4>

<p>ooh alright, I didn’t think much of the verse, but that incredible retro, bombastic chorus kinda sold me for a minute on this track</p>

<p>I think at times this track is absolutely disgusting with how overblown it is, but it’s not awful a lot of the time, it’s just an acquired feeling</p>

<h4>Moth’s Wings</h4>

<p>wow okay, the much more toned-down, less in-your-face energy of this track suits Angelakos and his vocality so much better to my ears</p>

<p>it’s a much better combination of both the hyper instrumentals of the last two tracks without any of the bombastic energy that wane on being ear-grating</p>

<p>I’m liking this shift, that was a damn good track :)</p>

<h4>The Reeling</h4>

<p>okay this is a great turn, I’m much more intrigued by this aesthetic- DAMN that introduction and the skipping of the beat :O</p>

<p>and those horns are actually pretty endearing, just this first verse and chorus are so much more well done to my ears :D</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyday I lie awake and pray to God today&#39;s the day<br/>Oh no, oh no<br/>Here I am, oh here I am, oh when will someone understand?<br/>Oh no, oh no</p>
</blockquote>

<p>jesus okay, and the chaotic concern and anxiety of the vocals makes this so much more interesting to me ^^</p>

<h4>Eyes as Candles</h4>

<p>this might not be as instantly compelling as the last track, but this is for sure another example of that better mix of instrumentals and vocals-</p>

<p>and while that hook is incredibly obnoxious… it is sort of infectious, I have to admit</p>

<p>NOT WEAK</p>

<p>that was a great breakdown tho, I gotta be honest</p>

<h4>Swimming in the Flood</h4>

<p>okay this might be my favorite of the more mellow tracks on this record, the aesthetic and instrumental styling sold me almost immediately</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What can I do?<br/>The river is overrun<br/>We&#39;re swimming in a flood, you know?<br/>I thought I felt your touch<br/>But the water is rising up<br/>Now all my lovers raise their cups</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that’s a damn good chorus too, I think my opinion of this record might be slowly shifting more and more positively :)</p>

<p>especially with that incredible punchy electronic bass drum, that’s such a lovely sort of sound</p>

<h4>Folds in Your Hands</h4>

<p>okay I thought that up to the chorus that was a slightly off-put sort of introduction, but when that chorus ended :O</p>

<p>I’m just lost with the organization of this track, and in (surprisingly) a nice sort of way ^^</p>

<p>THERE WE GO, finally the right amount of closure after that chorus, thank u</p>

<h4>To Kingdom Come</h4>

<p>mm I’m not sure I have as great an immediate connection with this one; it’s certainly well-made as are most of the tracks here, but just not much to my ears I guess</p>

<p>yea I just don’t have as much of a reaction or ties to that lyrical high- it’s probably a me thing, but this track just feels more of a transition</p>

<p>I love the post-chorus though, that and the instrumental after are charming in themselves in all honesty</p>

<h4>Sleepyhead</h4>

<p>and now the good shit- this track is absolutely wonderful, and it’s only ten seconds in</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you said it was like fire around the brim<br/>Burning solid, burning thin the burning rim<br/>Like stars burning holes right through the dark<br/>Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes<br/>You were one inch from the edge of this bed<br/>I drag you back a sleepyhead, sleepyhead</p>
</blockquote>

<p>my god, with the sample at the onset, and then this first verse/chorus combination… I just love everything chaotic and childish about this song (even though it’s about Angelakos’s ex being mad at him for sleeping in- which thinking about it, is exactly what this song <em>would</em> be about)</p>

<p>it doesn’t last as long as I think it could, especially with how well it’s done, so I guess that’s my only complaint</p>

<h4>Let Your Love Grow Tall</h4>

<p>mmm I’m not initially tied down well to that transition away from Sleepyhead… especially with only just the simple drum beat that comes right after (even if the bass and rest of the instrumental gets going right after)</p>

<p>okay but that choir aesthetic is really nice, and the glimmering high synths are such a good fit to be honest</p>

<p>I’m just not convinced it’s a great transition- I’ll see how this record ends off I guess</p>

<h4>Seaweed Song</h4>

<p>okay okay, slow start is perfectly alright for this ^^</p>

<p>nevermind, I stand corrected like a moron, there’s a lot of drum and bass</p>

<p>oooh alright then, I wasn’t connecting much to that first chorus, but with that functionally simplistic bass line under it (along with the rest of the context of the track)- damn that’s good :)</p>

<p>overall pretty good ending to a pretty good record, I’m glad it didn’t trip over as much as I was expecting</p>
