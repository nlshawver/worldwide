<h2>notes for january 22</h2>

<h1>Apricot Princess by Rex Orange County</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Apricot Princess</h4>

<p>that’s a really beautiful introduction, I love the instrumentation</p>

<p>I might be initially a bit turned away from his voice, but it’s certainly not bad whatsoever- and this beat change felt weird at first but that’s damn good :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I wanna show them<br/>How much I need her, I&#39;m in this place again<br/>Yeah, I wanna show them<br/>That this ain&#39;t a fantasy, she&#39;s my best fucking friend</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the intonation in his voice there is wonderful ^</p>

<p>wow this track really grew into something special, I love the styling and just the whole energy of the track</p>

<h4>Television / So Far So Good</h4>

<p>nice lil transition- eyebrow raise at the bridge :O</p>

<p>ohhh it’s this song, I got it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m in love and she remains in my life<br/>Back when we spoke in Europe<br/>I need insurance on my emotions<br/>I can&#39;t get hurt again<br/>Fuck the past, fuck them, they all made me sad<br/>And I had no time to prepare to face my fears<br/>I guess that it&#39;s time that I dried these tears</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I absolutely love the bridges, the intonation and shift in his vocal styling is wonderful :)</p>

<p>and I think the toned down, more mellow second part and outro is a very good choice ^</p>

<h4>Nothing (feat. Marco McKinnis)</h4>

<p>I think it’s a bit typical or expected, but the instrumentation on this record is done really well, and it’s mixed in a good kind of way :)</p>

<p>just stuck out to be with this beat, it’s minimal but it meshes with both Rex and Marco’s vocals ^^</p>

<p>god that last verse &amp; outro is so damn good and just the right amount of out there; this is definitely my favorite of these opening tracks so far</p>

<h4>Sycamore Girl</h4>

<p>ooh I can already tell this is gonna be good, this beat is amazing</p>

<p>I feel like the verses are good, but the chorus only sort of landed right for me; it didn’t necessarily sound all that special</p>

<p>okay Thea’s vocals are really nice tho :O</p>

<p>wow alright that second chorus hits so well, that’s good ^^</p>

<p>I put the words back in my mouth</p>

<h4>Untitled</h4>

<p>damn… that’s a really soulful interlude with Rex’s vocals in such a simplistic setting, I love this slight little downturn</p>

<p>I don’t think this is obviously a great song in terms of standalone value, but it seems to fit very, very nicely into this tracklist</p>

<p>the whistling is kinda shrill at the onset but I don’t rly mind</p>

<h4>4 Seasons</h4>

<p>DAMN okay that first verse into that crescendo and second piece is so well done, that’s special</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I&#39;m flying back to L.A.​<br/>And I can&#39;t wait for her to see<br/>And I&#39;m not fucking with first class<br/>But I&#39;d sure like a sleeper seat, so</p>
</blockquote>

<p>absolutely love that vocal line right into the third verse and this punching bass drum and synth lines :)</p>

<p>I adore that ending chorus, gave me goosebumps; this is my favorite so far ^^</p>

<h4>Waiting Room</h4>

<p>ooh that’s such a charming little vocal line at the ending of the first verse, such a mellow intonation :)</p>

<p>that’s almost a bit of a toned-down interlude; I think it fits well in the context of the record, and I like the energy</p>

<h4>Rain Man</h4>

<p>okay this is the real interlude lol</p>

<h4>Never Enough</h4>

<p>woah okay, I was not expecting that beat change given the introduction, that’s surprisingly energetic :O</p>

<p>damn that chorus took me for a trip, I love that shock of an ending right into… I don’t even know, this track is just an absolute treat :)</p>

<p>jesus this track is so driving and crushing, I love the constantly shifting aesthetic and tone ^^</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But that&#39;s never enough<br/>&#39;Cause when you lose the ones you love<br/>You might find it hard to cry<br/>Until it&#39;s only you and everybody else has left the room<br/>You might feel what it&#39;s like to not know how to feel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>such a good, radiant sort of breakdown, this is the standout track now for sure</p>

<h4>Happiness</h4>

<p>this is surprisingly soulful, and I think this fits well in the album’s trajectory in terms of its conclusion</p>

<p>it’s just a bit of an expected ending, that’s all</p>

<p>I really like the vocal lines, and I think his lower register is genuinely charming- I was not expecting that absolutely shredded guitar line, that’s how you make this track so much more interesting :O</p>

<p>he should do that more :)</p>
