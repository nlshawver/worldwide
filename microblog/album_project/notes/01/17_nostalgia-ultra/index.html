<h2>notes for january 17</h2>

<h1>nostalgia,ULTRA. by Frank Ocean</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Street Fighter</h4>

<p>yoo street fighter :O</p>

<h4>Strawberry Swing</h4>

<p>okay now onto the actual song :)</p>

<p>I really like the energy of this track, the themes are immediately present, and the vocals over this very plucky instrumental are really nice ^</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are all mortals, aren&#39;t we?<br/>Any moment this could go<br/>Cry, cry, cry, oh<br/>Even though that won&#39;t change a thing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the vocal lines are great too :O</p>

<p>oh my god that Chris Martin sample for the outro was so unexpected and way better than I was expecting; lovely start BESIDES THE ALARM</p>

<h4>Novacane</h4>

<p>I really like these drawn out verses that describe this whole story arc, it’s really well done even if I’m not the biggest fan of this song as a whole</p>

<p>it’s certainly damn good though, don’t get me wrong ^</p>

<p>ooh and those layered vocals on the bridge are so well crafted :)</p>

<h4>We All Try</h4>

<p>damn I love that first verse, it’s a really nice aesthetic over a relatively simple instrumental; same thing with the chorus, but even better :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t believe our nation&#39;s flag is on the moon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>haha I really hope he’s taking the theme of the verse, as in our nation’s power shouldn’t cover the cosmos- and not that the moon landing is fake lmao</p>

<p>but anyways, yea that song is amazing, I love that ^</p>

<h4>Bitches Talkin’ (Metal Gear Solid)</h4>

<p>I really like these tiny instrumental pieces, it’s such a nice energy to the record and it adds to the pacing well</p>

<h4>Songs For Women</h4>

<p>damn that instrumental is absolutely a bop, that’s lovely :D</p>

<p>and that first verse is done really well, this is likely my favorite track on the record/mixtape so far :)</p>

<p>god I love that chorus, it’s so cocky and for such a good reason given his voice is genuinely something special</p>

<h4>Lovecrimes</h4>

<p>hmm this is a really interesting instrumental, and I do like the addition of the bongos (:</p>

<p>it’s a really solid introspection of situations love get people into, and I think this sort of vibe compliments that thematic choice ^</p>

<p>especially that outro again, it’s such an emotive, painful end</p>

<h4>Goldeneye</h4>

<p>overrated game</p>

<h4>There Will Be Tears</h4>

<p>oooh my lord, I was unsure about this at first but that beat sold me- this is damn good especially given the two last tracks leading up to it :O</p>

<p>and it’s such a painful topic too, done so well</p>

<h4>Swim Good</h4>

<p>damn, that’s another really good intro, I love that :)</p>

<p>OOOH that chorus is so good, absolutely lovely</p>

<p>god and that build-up with the pre-chorus is an absolutely soaring and emotional addition- and the same goes for that outro chorus, this is my new favorite track ^^</p>

<h4>Dust</h4>

<p>hmm, I thought that track was good like the rest of this mixtape, but it just didn’t stick out nearly as much as the rest of the tracklist to me</p>

<p>I do think that ending pre-chorus &amp; chorus are the focal point, that was pretty good</p>

<h4>American Wedding (feat. James Fauntleroy)</h4>

<p>I absolutely love this re-imagining of Hotel California, it’s absolutely lovely if not simplistic in nature</p>

<p>that chorus is really somber compared to the original, it’s a nice change- and the layered vocals that come immediately after fit really well right after ^</p>

<p>damn and that second verse is stunning, the vocality and themes are amazing to me</p>

<p>there we go with that second chorus :D</p>

<h4>Soul Calibur</h4>

<p>better than goldeneye imo</p>

<h4>Nature Feels</h4>

<p>AHH haha I really like Ocean’s vocals over these old and new classics, so damn nice :)</p>

<p>I love the ‘soulful warbling’ genius describes this as, I completely agree since he drifts in and out of the original cadence during the verse, which is just so well done</p>

<p>god the theme of this song is both so crude and incredibly alluring- and my lord that little skip to get to the bridge is absolutely striking</p>

<p>but it just cuts, and it’s over</p>
