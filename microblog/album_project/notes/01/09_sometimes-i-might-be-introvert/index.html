<h2>notes for january 9</h2>

<h1>Sometimes I Might Be Introvert by Little Simz</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Introvert</h4>

<p>damn okay, these horns &amp; drum combination is a fantastic start for me so far</p>

<p>my god, that was such a smooth introduction, I love this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not into politics, but I know it&#39;s dark times<br/>Parts of the world still living in apartheid</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it might be basic coming from an american but the fact she has a british accent makes this feel so unique; stellar track so far</p>

<p>holy shit that entire second verse is a masterpiece, this is already a standout song for me this month</p>

<p>damn… that is a powerful song if I’ve ever heard it</p>

<h4>Woman (feat. Cleo Sol)</h4>

<p>and I love how the last line of Introvert leads right into this track, it feels so good</p>

<p>the instrumentation change-up also fits really well, this laidback energy feels like a step sideways from the intro track (in a very good way, it continues on perfectly)</p>

<p>god these verses are so well-written, and the chorus by Cleo Sol sounds so uplifting, and it makes me appreciate both of their voices more</p>

<p>I have no idea what mixing is, but the way the vocals mesh with the instrumentals feels so intentional, and so well-made</p>

<p>I am a sucker for voicemail outros :)</p>

<h4>Two Worlds Apart</h4>

<p>another good transition to my ears, very nice</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I need something deeper, money does not stimulate me<br/>Whether you got mansions or got diamonds in your AP</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that sounds so smooth; and I absolutely love the repetition set on different themes, like with the start of this bar at the end of the first verse (it’s through the whole thing tho):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Patience, patience, patience, patience, patience<br/>London-born estate girl to international sensation<br/>Cuttin&#39; through your settings, do not need an invitation<br/>Baskin&#39; in this feeling, if I must say, it&#39;s amazing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that was a great final verse and a nice ending, right into:</p>

<h4>I Love You, I Hate You</h4>

<p>my god, what an instrumental :O</p>

<p>and such a stunning verse with this sample, I am genuinely taken aback by how smooth this record feels so far</p>

<p>oh my god… this song is stunning, and that’s such a punchy end to the second verse</p>

<p>and again, the instrumentation choices are perfectly unique and fitting; the bongos fit really well in the immediate background of this whole soundscape she has going</p>

<p>I can’t give this whole thing enough praise…</p>

<h4>Little Q, Pt. 1 (Interlude)</h4>

<p>and that is a very good interlude, don’t have much else to say; well-placed and well-executed</p>

<h4>Little Q, Pt. 2</h4>

<p>and a very nice continuation of the beat, love that :D</p>

<p>this is another stacked verse, and I absolutely love how the sample comes alive for the chorus, thematically it just fits like a glove around this track</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The broken homes in which we&#39;re comin&#39; from, but who&#39;s to blame when<br/>You&#39;re dealt the same cards from the system you&#39;re enslaved in?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>damn… no words for how mf good that bar is</p>

<p>and I love how she ends the verse by signing “Q,” just like how the interlude ended off, and it all just sounds amazing</p>

<p>some of her vocals are a bit washed out at the end, but I don’t care; if anything it fits with the whole aesthetic of this (and the last) track</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We all know real criminals live in the suit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you know ^^</p>

<h4>Gems (Interlude)</h4>

<p>a great transition to this interlude again, I think these brief moments of resting on the record really fit thematically, and just wrap everything up nicely (so far, but I can’t see this record getting worse at all)</p>

<p>damn these lines just connect so well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you want fifteen years or fifteen minutes?</p>

<p>Pressure makes diamonds<br/>Do not fold</p>
</blockquote>

<p>damn this outro feels so transcendent :O</p>

<h4>Speed</h4>

<p>I was not expecting this kind of change-up, and while I’m not a huge fan of the beat, this attitude change feels so emotional and powerful, love it again</p>

<p>yea that ending is ofc pretty good, but I’m just a bit thrown off by the synth stuttering</p>

<h4>Standing Ovation</h4>

<p>but damn if that isn’t another fantastic transition into an amazing beat; those drums are an amazing fit with these chord stings</p>

<p>amazing end to the verse, and into a smooth, supple chorus; great as usual</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know my people wanna see me win, I&#39;ll never let you down<br/>Standin&#39; ovation for the one who&#39;s wearin&#39; a crown<br/>I got royalty in my blood, I was born great<br/>Don&#39;t allow anyone to undermine your fate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this just sounds utterly fantastic, I love this record; genuinely got goosebumps on the third verse… I think I like this a bit</p>

<p>you’d think I could stop complimenting this record, but apparently I cannot- another standout outro</p>

<h4>I See You</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Lookin&#39; at you, I know that God took His time<br/>Hope I&#39;m seein&#39; the real you, not a disguise</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this track is beautiful, with another great Cleo Sol chorus :)</p>

<p>not much else to say though, it just feels so much like casual introspection</p>

<h4>The Rapper That Came to Tea (Interlude)</h4>

<p>woah, this spoken verse sounds so unique over this almost classical piece in the background</p>

<p>while this piece at the end gets repetitive, the fact that the singers work around the key sounds so special, and it just cuts off so short-</p>

<h4>Rollin Stone</h4>

<p>just as I was starting to worry about this record dragging along at the end, you get this mf banger at the exact right time for me; that first verse sounds so damn smooth over this simplistic, punchy instrumental</p>

<p>and damn… I love the energy of the second verse, such a confident ballad; and my god, that reversal of the track in the third verse right back into it is amazing :O</p>

<h4>Protect My Energy</h4>

<p>AHHH such a groove on this :D</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Total silence is my therapy<br/>I don&#39;t need your sympathy<br/>Internal guidance is all that I seek<br/>Don&#39;t disturb my inner peace</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and that’s such a slick line into a great earworm bridge, I love this track so much :)</p>

<p>I think the track ends a bit briefly, but the quality of the track is just off the charts- clear favorite for me atm</p>

<h4>Never Make Promises (Interlude)</h4>

<p>huh, I still like the interludes a lot, but I do think the record leans on them a bit</p>

<h4>Point and Kill (feat. Obongjayar)</h4>

<p>but to be fair, the interlude really helps lead into this track; I love this first chorus and verse, sounds so smooth in its own vibe and attitude</p>

<p>another damn good verse, into that chorus with the HORNS</p>

<p>dude, this record is great</p>

<h4>Fear No Man</h4>

<p>these transitions feel so natural, and this was yet another one of them</p>

<p>I am starting to wonder how this record is gonna come down, I hope this starts to cap it off in a great way</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can always trust I&#39;ll give you somethin&#39; new to vibe with<br/>Heads turn when I pull up lookin&#39; stylish<br/>Ain&#39;t your typical rapper, I ain&#39;t got my neck froze<br/>Still, your favourite artist couldn&#39;t even step close</p>
</blockquote>

<p>haha I love that attitude, this feels so groovy again :)</p>

<p>such a good third verse too, this record feels so special and unique ^^</p>

<h4>The Garden (Interlude)</h4>

<p>there might be one too many interludes for my liking, but my god if they aren’t all meaningful and fit right where they should be…</p>

<h4>How Did You Get Here</h4>

<p>I’m a sucker for these gospel-like vocals to start this, it’s such a nice energy to have going into this second-last track</p>

<p>this is definitely my second favorite right now, the vocals sound so heartfelt and important, I love this </p>

<h4>Miss Understood</h4>

<p>okay this is for sure the perfect vibe to have on the very tail end of this record- and I love that CD line</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you&#39;re in the worst, lowest place, still could never crash<br/>Strong women bounce back and secure bags</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this too, that’s good ^^</p>

<p>and I love how it sounds like she’s rethinking right before she gets into her anger getting the best of her</p>

<p>wow… and that’s all that</p>
