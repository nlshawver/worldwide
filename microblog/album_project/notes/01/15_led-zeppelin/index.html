<h2>notes for january 15</h2>

<h1>self-titled by Led Zeppelin</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Good Times Bad Times</h4>

<p>jesus this is one of the best discography introductions ever, the first four bars are so iconic</p>

<p>there&#39;s gonna be a lot of compliments for these guitar solos lol</p>

<p>and my god the drums too of course; this track is incredible, I don&#39;t know what else to say</p>

<h4>Babe I&#39;m Gonna Leave You</h4>

<p>hmm I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard this before-</p>

<p>wait that instrumental splash before he says baby a ton sounds really good (and familiar)</p>

<p>my god that screaming vocal line was honestly really damn good</p>

<p>wait that guitar riff is so familiar, I had no idea it was in this; I like that a lot tho</p>

<p>that was honestly really good, better than I expected; and that ending was really well done with just Plant&#39;s vocals and that subtle guitar line ^</p>

<h4>You Shook Me</h4>

<p>huh, I didn&#39;t really click with this at first but as it went on I think the personality of it carries the track; and that organ piece is shockingly fitting here</p>

<p>I have to be honest with you though, that harmonica part is gross- and while the guitar solo piece is better by a wide margin, I&#39;m really not liking this</p>

<p>the ending is okay tho, the vocals are kinda impressive in all honesty</p>

<h4>Dazed and Confused</h4>

<p>but thank god I get to listen to this absolute masterpiece now- that introduction with the commanding bass line, the soaring guitars throughout the track, and that buildup to the crescendo is absolutely stunning</p>

<p>god that mf guitar is so perfect, that&#39;s some goosebumps</p>

<p>have to compliment how shrill Plant&#39;s vocals are, but they&#39;re still so shredding and somehow soulful at the same time ^</p>

<h4>Your Time Is Gonna Come</h4>

<p>oh god I&#39;m not a huge fan of this already</p>

<p>somehow that chorus isn&#39;t all that bad to me, I just really don&#39;t like the very obvious meshing of country and rock; it just sounds a bit forced and just too much for me</p>

<p>the outro is way better to my ears since it&#39;s not tied to that aesthetic</p>

<h4>Black Mountain Side</h4>

<p>I do like that fading transition, and I think that instrumental is honestly kinda charming- especially given that it&#39;s an interlude</p>

<h4>Communication Breakdown</h4>

<p>alright this is pretty good, but honestly I don&#39;t entirely get the appeal; it doesn&#39;t have nearly as much of a personality as the first few parts of this record</p>

<p>I will admit that this song is vastly better and more iconic than the more bluesy stuff they made on this record; it feels kinda forced and unnatural to me, I&#39;m just not a huge fan</p>

<h4>I Can&#39;t Quit You Baby</h4>

<p>yea like this- I&#39;ll admit the guitar sounds rly damn good here, but the attitude isn&#39;t quite there for me</p>

<p>there are a few genuinely really good guitar riffs and it&#39;s well made of course; it just does not mesh at all with my ears</p>

<h4>How Many More Times</h4>

<p>same with the intro of this, like come on</p>

<p>like the midsection is this song is genuinely good, since they&#39;re sticking to more of the rock sound, but that intro is just gross given the rest of the track</p>

<p>and okay, the marching along aesthetic of the outro (of the first part) is rly good and a great pick up from the rest of what I didn&#39;t really like</p>

<p>yea this is really good, movie soundtrack energy ^</p>

<p>OHHHH when the drums come back in- that&#39;s the most out of pocket thing this record has done and I love it, pretty good ending to this weird record</p>
