<h2>notes for january 24</h2>

<h1>Brown Sugar by D’Angelo</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Brown Sugar</h4>

<p>okay already with this instrumental this thing is promising, it’s such an infectious, mellow groove :O</p>

<p>I also love the disguise of a love song masking the fact that this is in essence an appreciation for the indica strain of marijuana :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stick out my tongue and I&#39;m &#39;bout<br/>Ready to hit this pretty gritty<br/>Bitty with persistence<br/>Yo, I don&#39;t think y&#39;all hear me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>god that’s such a crisp line, and the delivery is so casually confident, this is a wonderful introduction ^^</p>

<h4>Alright</h4>

<p>damn alright, what a funky introduction- that sample of the drum beat is absolutely incredible :O</p>

<p>and I knew he had a good singing voice, but some of D’Angelo’s vocality and the certain sort of intonations in his voice are lovely to hear so clearly :)</p>

<p>and I’ll always love a fadeout, they seem to always be a nice touch to keep the taste of the song on your palate</p>

<h4>Jonz in My Bonz</h4>

<p>this is another sort of mellow, soothing track, and I think it’s a good place to go after the last track</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s anything of a standout track, but I think it serves a useful purpose on the record- and it’s lovely to listen to of course :)</p>

<h4>Me and Those Dreamin’ Eyes of Mine</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it just that you&#39;re the finest little thing that I ever saw?<br/>Or is my imagination runnin&#39; too far?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>god this pre-chorus and chorus is stellar, the half-jazz, snapping beat is such a great tonality and energy to this track (and I absolutely love the vocals, as always)</p>

<p>and that guitar improvisation behind the beat is lovely, such a nice touch</p>

<h4>Sh★t, Damn, Motherf★cker</h4>

<p>wow and I really like that harsh transition, especially with that funky riff that leads this track on :O</p>

<p>and it sounds almost playful in the chorus, despite the crushing topic ^</p>

<p>god this such slick, soul-crushing violence just resting on top of this incredible groove of an instrumental- this is chocolate-dipped murder and I love its aesthetic :)</p>

<h4>Smooth</h4>

<p>that’s such a slamming instrumental; with the mellow and delicate piano and instrumentation around it, it feels so gentle in this sultry kind of way- which is pure bliss to hear ^^</p>

<p>another good fade out with that repeating chorus</p>

<h4>Cruisin’</h4>

<p>jesus christ, everything about this track is unadulterated euphoria; I cannot get over how lovely this is to hear :D</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re gonna fly away<br/>Glad you&#39;re going my way<br/>I love it when we&#39;re cruisin&#39; together</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the vocality and sensuality of that chorus line is wonderful, especially when there’s D’Angelo’s backing vocals playing around it the whole time ^^</p>

<p>yea he just dances around the main chorus, giving these soulful vocal lines over such a supple instrumental and melody; same goes with the backing harmony as well</p>

<p>god his voice is transcendent- the fact that this track is six and a half minutes doesn’t even matter because of how lovely this track is</p>

<p>this is an absolute gem of a masterpiece :))</p>

<h4>When We Get By</h4>

<p>I was initially hopeful because of the jazz intonation and styling, then worried a bit because I thought it might be a bit of a letdown</p>

<p>then I heard his voice and the whole track was just instantly like a wave of chilled out soulfulness- and it was good :)</p>

<p>and that warbled (whatever you technically call it) trumpet just adds to the jazz aesthetic of the whole song ^</p>

<h4>Lady</h4>

<p>damn this is already a trip with such a strong, driving bass line over this whole instrumental</p>

<p>and just more instantly recognizable, timeless vocalization- as always ^^</p>

<p>I would normally think of those claps towards the tail end of this as being a bit derivative and meaningless, but they fit surprisingly well into the aesthetic of this track- so I like it much more than I thought :)</p>

<h4>Higher</h4>

<p>ooh, and I love the subtle tone of the piano of the last track, into the perfect swagger of this track</p>

<p>between the gentle chaos of the cymbals at the onset, to the driving, punchy bass drum in the midst of these wonderful harmonies, it’s impossible to get rid of this sort of groove and aesthetic from my head :D</p>

<p>what an absolutely eminent, captivating end to such a phenomenal album :)</p>
