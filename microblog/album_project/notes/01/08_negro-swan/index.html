<h2>notes for january 8</h2>

<h1>Negro Swan by Blood Orange</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Orlando</h4>

<p>punchy instrumental with some sweet vocal lines right out of the gate :)</p>

<p>kind of a weird synth placement, but the vibe of the track overall has such a good cohesive flow- feels like nodding in and out of a trance</p>

<p>and I like that outro to the track, wraps it up quite well</p>

<h4>Saint</h4>

<p>nice synth keys with these layered vocals :O</p>

<p>saxophone will always be a good choice ESPECIALLY with that out of no where beat track</p>

<p>I think it looses a bit of its luster soon after, but it’s still a great combination with the rest of the instrumental</p>

<p>that is such a nice interlude though, damn</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Spreading all my love for you<br/>You never tell me all that you do<br/>Quiet when it&#39;s done, will you ever run?</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Take Your Time</h4>

<p>I do really like Hynes’s vocals, but I think at times it can be a bit tinny in nature, which I don’t really mesh with as well as I’d like; it is still really damn good though obviously</p>

<p>while the basis of these instrumentals have been these bedroom synths, I absolutely love the extra instrument choices, like the saxophone last track, and the winds this time</p>

<p>yea that ending feels transcendent as ever</p>

<h4>Hope (feat. Puff Daddy &amp; Tei Shi)</h4>

<p>sort of an abrupt change of pace from the last track, but this stuttering, drunken backing track is so nice of a change-up</p>

<p>Tei Shi does a really good job with the verse, it feels so soulful and like a response to Devonté’s previous few tracks</p>

<p>that little stutter right before the chorus is played out a lot, but it never ceases to compliment almost every track that uses it</p>

<p>I don’t think Puff is saying anything fantastic or out-there, but the combination with the continuing vocals and the improvisation on the piano just makes it such a nice energy on the ending portion of this one</p>

<p>with such a nice chord that fades out the track :D</p>

<h4>Jewelry</h4>

<p>these talking breaks with instrument improvisations are so nice, it’s like an introspective break every once in a while</p>

<p>smooth as butter chorus… with a break right before a punchy drum beat that genuinely kinda caught me off guard</p>

<p>god that chorus feels so good to hear</p>

<p>wow that is a powerful ending, that’s such a meaningful set of lines that just ring out for such a small amount of time before the track is cut short:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Red and blue lights on my stone<br/>Go back to being unknown<br/>Relax your hair<br/>Tuck your shirt<br/>Put your glasses on<br/>Play your guitar</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Family (feat. Janet Mock)</h4>

<p>that’s a damn well made interlude, I love it- using the same beat as:</p>

<h4>Charcoal Baby</h4>

<p>this song just feels so perfectly well done, everything comes together in such a powerful yet smooth-as-silk way in each chorus</p>

<p>and I love that the last chorus is cut in a way that gets right to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you break sometimes?<br/>No one, no one</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and my god… the beat change is immaculately done; five out of five track</p>

<h4>Vulture Baby</h4>

<p>jesus, that is a shocking cut off from the last track, into this jazzy beat break with some nice vocals that go along with this energy</p>

<h4>Chewing Gum (feat. A$AP Rocky &amp; Project Pat)</h4>

<p>this is a nice change up again, even if the track isn’t all that unique or incredibly interesting at the onset</p>

<p>but even then, everything just sounds so good as a cohesive piece</p>

<p>honestly wasn’t sold on Rocky’s verse at first, but that is</p>

<p>and jesus what an outro, that just feels intentionally off-kilter and uncomfortable</p>

<h4>Holy Will (feat. Ian Isaiah)</h4>

<p>I wouldn’t understand that shrill intro without these high and soulful lines that come right after, they seem to contrast each other in a good sort of way</p>

<p>with the lack of much instrumentation I can’t help but feel left out- but only to a point, until these harmonized vocals come in and just feel so inviting and exciting</p>

<p>I think this could have been a bit of a drag-on if not for those slight instrumentals and the constant altering of those instruments used</p>

<p>some very nice chords into a well-place off-pace drum beat, the ending works very well for me</p>

<h4>Dagenham Dream</h4>

<p>honestly I keep getting surprised by Hynes’s voice, it does have a relatively good range of personality in different contexts that can work wonders for these different tracks</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Broken teeth and bloody nose but least it snowed<br/>Instantly dry, oh, I cried and cut a line<br/>In my eyebrow acted like the boys in town<br/>Then my teacher told me that this, made her sad<br/>Had to act just like the others to get around<br/>Friday nights alone in Ilford with my board</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is such a good piece of the verse, knowing all of the meaning and hearing what he’s saying feels exactly like something that all of us have dealt with at times- which just works so well to make this feel personable</p>

<p>especially with the outro that has almost exactly this same message- it works so well alongside his unique perspective (to many) of feeling like the ‘Negro Swan’ this record is named for, in comparison to those around him</p>

<h4>Nappy Wonder</h4>

<p>ooh, some nice chord progressions with perfectly spaced kickdrums to my ears- and these synths just feel so nice with the completely overblown guitar</p>

<p>and such a nice pre-chorus with some smooth wordplay:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m riding switch, I can&#39;t escape<br/>I bust it up on Ilford Lane<br/>A pleasure flip up to my grade</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it feels so perfectly chaotic, it’s pretty and crazy and contrasts perfectly to get right to this last chorus</p>

<h4>Runnin’ (feat. Georgia Anne Muldrow)</h4>

<p>this is exactly what you’d want to hear in a slump, this type of track just feels pleasant with this type of energy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just hold on to your mighty way of being</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t even know how to say how this record makes me feel, it feels like a cohesive unit of spoken word and these smooth, soulful verses that work wonders</p>

<h4>Out of Your League (feat. Steve Lacy)</h4>

<p>this overblown kick-drum bit with these vocals are again a bit of an exciting turn in comparison, and I love it</p>

<p>dude I told you, that stutter gap is immaculate</p>

<h4>Minetta Creek</h4>

<p>more nice piano lines, with these buttery vocal lines that I love- typical great stuff from this album</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Find a means to drive away grief<br/>Choose your sex to find a relief<br/>Nothing is forgiven, black skin and my rhythm<br/>And you know that it&#39;s all at a cost</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that might have been my favorite line on my second favorite instrumental, damn that’s powerful</p>

<h4>Smoke</h4>

<p>these are some beautifully articulated vocal lines over this amazing guitar section- this is such a good outro to such a good record</p>
