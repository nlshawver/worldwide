<h2>notes for january 23</h2>

<h1>Watching Movies with the Sound Off by Mac Miller</h1>

<hr />

<h4>The Star Room</h4>

<p>I’m not sure how I feel about this as an introduction; I think the beat was almost trailing along, but Mac’s lines were the only personality I felt in the whole thing</p>

<p>it would’ve felt sterile without his presence, and even then it just felt casual</p>

<h4>Avian</h4>

<p>felt similarly about this song, but the second verse had much more of a pull on me</p>

<p>I’m still not really feeling this project at all yet; the chorus felt a bit off, but I’m obviously holding out</p>

<h4>I’m Not Real (feat. Earl Sweatshirt)</h4>

<p>okay this felt and sounded much better, I really liked the ending of Mac’s first verse right into Earl’s verse; that’s nice :)</p>

<p>god I absolutely loved that style of instrumentation and cadence with the verses, that was more of what I’m expecting with this sort of project</p>

<h4>S.D.S.</h4>

<p>and that’s a slick transition; this sort of chaos in his vocality is a really good shift after I’m Not Real ^^</p>

<p>kind of a crazed interlude, but the transitions of this thing so far are really satisfying :)</p>

<h4>Bird Call</h4>

<p>hahaha this song is completely ridiculous, and I love it for that so much ^</p>

<p>okay nevermind that got weird wth; that beat still nice though</p>

<h4>Matches (feat. Ab-Soul)</h4>

<p>oh my god, Mac’s first verse is so smooth, those were his best lines on the record so far :O</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could&#39;ve been smart, could&#39;ve been a doctor<br/>Life full of drama, little soap opera<br/>Fallin&#39; in love, lucky that I caught ya<br/>Almost got her knocked up, would&#39;ve been a father<br/>All about energy, make good memories<br/>I&#39;m the fuckin&#39; Dalai Lama</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that was a bit of a slam, I like that a lot :)</p>

<h4>I Am Who Am (Killin’ Time) [feat. Niki Randa]</h4>

<p>I really like the beat on this and the atmosphere of it, this is great so far :O</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Forfeitin&#39; the war, he lays his sword down and walks away<br/>Grabs a 40 from the corner store, begins to contemplate<br/>Dealin&#39; with death like he work in the morgue, absorbin&#39; souls forgotten<br/>He lost his way, starin&#39; down that barrel, thinkin&#39;, &quot;Not today&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>damn; with the beat that comes during and after this, that’s surprisingly well done ^^</p>

<p>god and I love the soundscape being made here, this is my favorite so far :)</p>

<h4>Objects in the Mirror</h4>

<p>this is a really smooth, unique sort of beat; I’m liking this too rn ^^</p>

<p>god and that chorus is so nice (even with the completely ridiculous sample going back and forth)</p>

<p>these last two tracks are the best for me so far, it’s peaking rn for me :)</p>

<h4>Red Dot Music (feat. Action Bronson &amp; Loaded Lux)</h4>

<p>god that end to the first bar is so stupid lol</p>

<p>okay the ending was much better- just taken out by that chorus even if it ends well with that ending line</p>

<p>ooh and that outro was shocking and really well made; I like that as a bit of an inter-song transition/interlude :O</p>

<h4>Gees (feat. ScHoolboy Q)</h4>

<p>damn this beat with that bass ^^</p>

<p>I love the little lines mixed into the verses, it’s such a weird, incredibly boastful energy</p>

<p>and I like it more than I expected :)</p>

<p>god that schoolboy verse was great too, I just hope this record doesn’t overstate its welcome with how long this lasts</p>

<h4>Watching Movies</h4>

<p>okay this is a really good sign; it’s interesting but very satisfying to hear Mac’s innocent-sounding vocality over top of this absolutely hard, powerful beat behind him</p>

<p>yea for sure; this is my second favorite rn, that went so well, I love that :)</p>

<h4>Suplexes Inside of Complexes and Duplexes (feat. Jay Electronica)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Do as a saint do, turn painful to graceful<br/>The devil on my trails, I&#39;m tryna find the Holy Grail<br/>*Coughs* Right there</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that’s genuinely the best “clever” bar that he’s had this record, and I love it over this creeping sort of beat :)</p>

<p>god and Jay Electronica’s verse is such a good compliment to this track, this album’s peak for me has been since I Am Who Am to here ^^</p>

<h4>REMember</h4>

<p>I think by the halfway point this track gets into its own and becomes a really good introspective break in this record, but I was just not meshing with it at the onset</p>

<p>yea the layered vocals compliment this a lot when you get into it ^</p>

<p>wow and honestly that guitar line fits shockingly well, I think that’s a really good send off for this track</p>

<h4>Someone Like You</h4>

<p>okay yea this record is not falling off at all so far; it keeps riding the line between too boastful and bombastic, and introspective and light in tone</p>

<p>I really like this album so far, I’m just still put off from the start unfortunately :/</p>

<h4>Aquarium</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you feel it?<br/>No, no, don&#39;t—don&#39;t answer that, that was a rhetorical question</p>
</blockquote>

<p>haha I love that introduction to this track</p>

<p>honestly a lot of these songs after I Am Who Am are just perfectly normal with just pretty good vocality, which is probably why I like them</p>

<p>it doesn’t feel transcendent or shockingly incredible, but it’s still catchy and the lines are well-made for sure ^^</p>

<h4>Youforia</h4>

<p>okay that was a really good ending for this record, Mac’s singing voice fits so nicely with the entire aesthetic of this song :)</p>
