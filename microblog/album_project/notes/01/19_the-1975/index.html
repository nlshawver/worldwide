<h2>notes for january 19</h2>

<h1>self-titled by The 1975</h1>

<hr />

<h4>The 1975</h4>

<p>I’ve only listened to a few songs off this project, but I always liked the introduction aesthetic to this song, and how well it transitions the album into the next song</p>

<p>can’t say much else here, the vocal harmony is nice, and it’s a pretty good intro imo</p>

<h4>The City</h4>

<p>damn aggressive drum introduction, and those are some powerful synths :O</p>

<p>this song is so amazingly off-kilter and punchy, I love this track even if it’s just a typical indie pop ballad</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your brother is just sat there, you said that you felt snide<br/>You hope that, that the boy will be alright</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that line with Healy’s inflection and accent does sound really damn smooth; the track does feel very overblown, but it kinda fits the narrative in its method- very solid track :)</p>

<h4>M.O.N.E.Y.</h4>

<p>that very chaotically smooth synth at the onset is pretty nice, and that little splash before the chorus is really damn good :O</p>

<p>just a very silky smooth track, nothing incredible but a very good sound- and the verses are an interesting mesh of almost a spoken word story and the typical cadence of Healy’s voice, which I think is actually pretty endearing</p>

<p>not a huge fan of the final outro lyrics, but that’s a weird, interesting instrumentation at the outset that’s pretty nice ^</p>

<h4>Chocolate</h4>

<p>my god this mf song</p>

<p>the guitars on this song always stuck out to me, the subtle, gentle plucking is so well done in the verses :)</p>

<p>it’s just the closest thing to an incredibly notable indie pop ballad on this album, and I love it for that so much- the vocal lines are catchy, the overall feel of the song is overpowering, but in a pretty good way</p>

<p>I love this track ^^</p>

<h4>Sex</h4>

<p>oooh that driving guitar- the vocal lines are pretty good here, but the song just feels so grossly bombastic</p>

<p>which, thinking about it, is entirely the point lol</p>

<p>I don’t know, this song is no doubt incredibly catchy and lovely to listen to at times, but it’s definitely not the high point of the album imo</p>

<h4>Talk!</h4>

<p>god the bass line definitely carries this song- and while I do really like the concept of being way more experimental with the instrumentation, I don’t think it really meshes well with the vocals, especially at the chorus</p>

<p>ooh yea exactly, verse 4 is really good and fits well, and I think the last chorus is the best by far given the overlapping vocals</p>

<h4>An Encounter</h4>

<p>nice little instrumental, and a great way to divide and prelude tracks on this record</p>

<h4>Heart Out</h4>

<p>not the biggest fan of this very marching kind of beat- and the vocal lines feel pretty sparse</p>

<p>that chorus is done pretty well, but it seems to be the only interesting part of the song so far- bruh that second verse lol</p>

<p>okay this kinda grew on me, and it’s definitely not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s just a typical song on the album; that bridge is pretty alright, but the thematic choices make it feel so much better going into the last chorus</p>

<h4>Settle Down</h4>

<p>ooh, great little smooth transition :)</p>

<p>okay damn this is really mf catchy; was not expecting this :O</p>

<p>I think this might be so far the most perfect combination of the instrumentation they brought to the table, along with Healy’s vocality- they’re much less grating and aggressive, but I think that compliments the style the most</p>

<p>sleeper track on this album for sure ^</p>

<h4>Robbers</h4>

<p>I do really like the fact that since Heart Out, the soundscape really hasn’t ended bc of those transitions, very nice</p>

<p>I feel like this is probably the weakest of these past three, it doesn’t bring anything additional to the table, and it’s not outstanding to my ears</p>

<p>the drawn out vocal lines are nice at the onset but just sort of fall on deaf ears by the end imo</p>

<p>I appreciate the story that’s being told, and I think it is pretty good for a song, but I just think the instrumentation is too boring to fit with such a heavy, gutting theme</p>

<h4>Girls</h4>

<p>especially when the album transitions right into this, what the hell?</p>

<p>I’m sorry, the cohesion of this record just got really weird, even if (and especially because) this track is an absolute banger- like the entire plot of the past song just means nothing to me anymore because of this disco-esque, celebrating track</p>

<p>okay anyways, this song absolutely slaps :)</p>

<p>the stuttering 80’s guitars fit amazingly well, and when Healy does a vocal inflection to fit a more exciting song it actually does sound really pleasing ^</p>

<h4>12</h4>

<p>that’s a nice little somber instrumental, I think that’s really nice given the comedown required after Girls</p>

<h4>She Way Out</h4>

<p>hmm I do really like the grossly smooth aesthetic of this track, but again I just don’t think this meshes quite well with the previous track- it’s much better than Robbers to Girls though, and this track is very catchy ^^</p>

<p>just a nice deep cut on this record, feels like a safe, car ride song (and in a good way, it feels like what Settle Down was to me: the band’s excited aesthetic without being bombastic, which is amazing to my ears)</p>

<h4>Menswear</h4>

<p>this is a good cooldown though, fits so much better; and I do actually really like the soundscape developing on this track</p>

<p>I think the bass and snapping/clapping fit the least though- it’s nice but to me it just overpowers the whole thing</p>

<p>it’s fine tho, the warping into Healy’s short verse is really damn good :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Free bar, that&#39;s the point<br/>Spilling Amaretto &#39;cause of previous joints<br/>I&#39;m sitting with a girl, fortunate placing<br/>Preceding railing racket off a porcelain basin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>like seriously, that’s the best set of vocal lines in the whole record imo, it’s so slick ^^</p>

<p>it’s a really fitting story behind it too, being just a day at a wedding; second best track on the album imo</p>

<h4>Pressure</h4>

<p>woah okay, another sort of aesthetic I wasn’t expecting, that’s nice :O</p>

<p>god this is so instantly catchy what the hell; that little instrumental break into the bridge + chorus was wonderful :)</p>

<p>good deep cut overall ^</p>

<h4>Is There Somebody Who Can Watch You?</h4>

<p>I don’t think this song fits the aesthetic of the whole album, but I don’t care, this is a nice little ending, and a surprisingly good story and vocality on the track as a whole</p>

<p>this fits really well as a closer</p>
