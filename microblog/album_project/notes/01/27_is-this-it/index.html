<h2>notes for january 27</h2>

<h1>Is This It by The Strokes</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Is This It</h4>

<p>I don’t think this is particularly transcendent or incredibly detailed, but that’s not what it’s trying to be; the guitar and bass lines are perfectly simplistic, and for the start of an indie rock record, this serves its purpose really well imo :)</p>

<h4>The Modern Age</h4>

<p>was a bit unsure about this track at first, with the marching drum line not doing much for me, but that bridge and of course the chorus was actually pretty good</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, in the sun, sun, having fun, it&#39;s in my blood<br/>I just can&#39;t help it<br/>Don&#39;t want you here right now, let me go</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and damn that guitar solo is wonderful :O</p>

<p>I do like how it feels like a veil is lifted off the instrumental when the chorus starts up, that’s a bit of a banger :)</p>

<h4>Soma</h4>

<p>that guitar riff, while repetitive on its own actually fits surprisingly well in this - I do like the aesthetic of this track and the record so far</p>

<p>it may just be recency bias or something similar, but none of these tracks seem incredible yet :/</p>

<p>but damn that outro was stunning :O</p>

<h4>Barely Legal</h4>

<p>oooh that opening guitar riff was damn good ^^</p>

<p>okay this is the standout track so far to me, that layered and in-sync instrumental and vocal line is executed so well :D</p>

<p>and damn, that third verse is iconic</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, I didn&#39;t take no shortcuts<br/>I spent the money that I saved up<br/>Oh, mama running out of luck<br/>And like my sister, don&#39;t give a fuck</p>
</blockquote>

<p>okay this energy just suits this so much better; it took only a little bit but this aesthetic so far is really good</p>

<h4>Someday</h4>

<p>this track doesn’t stick out to me as much, but the simplistic primary guitar line and drum beat do pair really nicely together</p>

<p>and as usual the chorus is quite well done, and has a good amount of meaning behind it with the theme of the track ^^</p>

<p>okay nvm this was a pretty good interlude if you think of it like that, it’s nice :)</p>

<h4>Alone, Together</h4>

<p>ooh I like those leading guitar chords on the main verses, and damn that transition to the chorus is surprisingly good :O</p>

<p>okay my god that outro is absolutely crushing; that’s fantastically done</p>

<h4>Last Nite</h4>

<p>yea we all know this one</p>

<p>everything kind of comes together for this track, these last four tracks have been a really good peak for the album so far :)</p>

<h4>Hard to Explain</h4>

<p>honestly the part that sticks out the most to me is that first chorus, that was stellar even if I was wary for the first half of the track ^</p>

<p>yea my god, that pre-chorus to chorus is such a great moment, this is a great continuation of the energy</p>

<h4>When It Started</h4>

<p>okay I forgot I had the U.S. version- either way though, this is a great sort of fast paced track to split from the last song</p>

<p>I think that second verse and chorus is the best, most expressive and interesting part of this track, I liked that :)</p>

<h4>Trying Your Luck</h4>

<p>I do kinda like this guitar riff- and the most exciting part of this track for me is that second verse and chorus yet again</p>

<p>I’m honestly not sure about this record anymore- it peaks really well, but it feels dragged out already even if it’s less than forty minutes</p>

<p>each of these tracks would be wonderful on their own, but as a cohesive unit I think this thing suffers for me the most</p>

<p>good ending tho</p>

<h4>Take It or Leave It</h4>

<p>this does seem like a good end, but I’m just already checked out</p>

<p>I’m sorry, this album was worth it, but the sum of its parts together feels much weaker than each track on its own</p>

<p>unfortunate ;(</p>
