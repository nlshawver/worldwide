<h2>notes for january 3</h2>

<h1>An Evening With Silk Sonic by Silk Sonic</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Silk Sonic Intro</h4>

<p>you can tell exactly how good this is gonna be just by this intro, damn…</p>

<p>silk… /sonic/</p>

<h4>Leave The Door Open</h4>

<p>honestly some of the lyrics are cheesy in the first verse, but the instrumental and vocals outweigh any of that</p>

<p>it might be a bit overblown for my taste at the crescendo, but the chorus ties it back down well (especially that nice dissonance at the end)</p>

<p>yea, in the final chorus I’m not a huge fan of Mar’s straining in his voice, but you just can’t deny how smooth his voice sounds when he immediately goes more to a more mellow intonation right after</p>

<h4>Fly As Me</h4>

<p>ooh, that’s nasty already, what the f- we’re four seconds in and that’s nasty? that’s some betty davis shit</p>

<p>seriously, this is so unbelievably good; Mars and Paak together are so likeable, it’s probably my favorite overall track out right now, such a banger</p>

<p>AND THAT BASS AT THE THIRD VERSE WITH PAAK</p>

<blockquote>
<p>UH<br/>SOMEBODY THIS FLY (OWWWW)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>perfect track, no hats</p>

<h4>After Last Night (with Thundercat &amp; Bootsy Collins)</h4>

<p>I don’t know how you transition away from that high point, but honestly that Collins intro to both Mars &amp; Paak singing simultaneously is a really good way</p>

<p>that first chorus is actually really good, a bit unexpected but yet again Mars has some wack vocal line he pulls out of no where that’s stunning</p>

<p>this is such a horny album lmao</p>

<p>I do think that last bridge is probably the best part of the track in its lead up to the end chorus, it compliments in a very nice way</p>

<p>damn this duo is already legendary</p>

<h4>Smokin Out The Window</h4>

<p>wait a minute</p>

<p>and now this is such a catchy, appealing– lustful yet hateful song, this is the clear popular star off this record, and I get why</p>

<p>I’m so happy for Paak :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look here, baby, I hope you find whatever it is that you need<br/>But I also hope that your triflin’ ass is walkin’ ‘round barefoot in these streets</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I should stop complimenting their vocal harmony together, but it’s so very hard not to</p>

<h4>Put On A Smile</h4>

<p>I think Collins fits this record surprisingly well to honestly, I was kinda shocked it worked like it did</p>

<p>that first verse is genuinely pretty powerful after the comedown of the last track:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could pretend when I’m out with my friends<br/>I ain’t thinkin’ about you<br/>I could pretend like I ain’t in my feelings<br/>But that ain’t true, nah (nah)<br/>When I called you out your name<br/>That was my ego, my pride and pain<br/>I should be a movie star<br/>The way I play the part like everything’s okay</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is definitely one of the best deep cuts on here, I like it a lot; the ambience with the rain is a very nice, subtle addition- alongside the instrumentation being overall good too of course</p>

<p>speaking of, I should point out how well the instruments are done</p>

<p>AHH THAT DRAWN OUT LINE :O</p>

<h4>777</h4>

<p>bro what is this</p>

<p>DAMN</p>

<p>nevermind this is the best deep cut; everything is the epitome of eccentric, gloating, and completely off the wall (despite the beat being so crisp)</p>

<p>definitely adding this to a playlist lol</p>

<h4>Skate</h4>

<p>I wonder how this record is gonna close out, especially after all of that ^</p>

<p>those strings fit so neatly into this vibe, I like that a lot</p>

<p>instrumentation right before the second main verse is perfect, again no hats</p>

<p>god that chorus is so crisp, I guess I got my answer since you can sort of assume how this continues off</p>

<h4>Blast Off</h4>

<p>honestly kinda surprised with the abrupt end, but not much at all with the vibe of this last intro</p>

<p>ah yea, this is definitely how to end lmao:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I took a little somethin’ to get here, yeah yeah<br/>I got a little more if you’re read, we can have it all</p>
</blockquote>

<p>random thought, possible lukewarm take: Bruno Mars has a similar vocal uniqueness and recognizable inflection to Ariana Grande</p>

<p>anyways yeah, this track is a pretty fitting ending, but I don’t think it’s honestly anything that’s crazy; it’s probably the weakest track on the record (but it still sounds damn good to my ears)</p>

<p>the key change in the long outro, and the fact is lasts so long are honestly good choices for it though (and Bootsy ending of course)</p>
