<h2>notes for january 4</h2>

<h1>Piñata by Freddie Gibbs &amp; Madlib</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Supplier</h4>

<p>pretty good instrumental to start this, the voice samples fit very well—</p>

<h4>Scarface</h4>

<p>wow okay, was not expecting this style, and that transition was very good</p>

<p>woah this instrumental :O</p>

<p>that verse was really good though, great start so far</p>

<p>and I know these samples, that’s a very nice addition ^^</p>

<h4>Deeper</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>I hope you feel the pain I’m feelin’ when you hear this song</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that’s real good</p>

<p>okay okay, the verse structure in this is really good, overall this is great even if it doesn’t feel entirely memorable or super special yet; the instrumentation is just really good (especially the verses &amp; ending of this one), and his voice compliments it all well</p>

<h4>High (feat. Danny Brown)</h4>

<p>ooh, good sample start– and it’s a much more slick verse right after that, especially in front of that bass-line &amp; kick drum combination :)</p>

<p>was not expecting Danny Brown’s verse, that’s stunning from him (I wouldn’t know how it compares, I haven’t listened to his stuff yet unfortunately)</p>

<p>madlib’s production is incredible as ever on this, god bless man</p>

<h4>Harold’s</h4>

<p>structure on this overall is pretty good so far, especially when the main tracks so far seem to do well on their own</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A skinny n––, six-wing, mild sauce<br/>With all the fries you can give me, I tear them bitches off</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that is a very slick bar, ez; the ending of the second bar right into that is quality stuff</p>

<h4>Bomb (feat. Raekwon)</h4>

<p>damn that first verse :O</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This busta owe me, now he act like he don’t know me<br/>Forty fo’ my closest homie, kill cockroaches like Tony<br/>Got Montana money, Newport 100 dipped in fluid<br/>Yo I had to smoke it, pupils dilated like silver dollars<br/>Now we loc’ing, call it devilish how I do bitch<br/>Fuck these n––s talking, I leave they thoughts on my shoestrings</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and that is a powerful bar right before Raekwon comes in…</p>

<p>Raekwon fits surprisingly well on this, that’s a good feature especially on a Madlib record where the beats sound so timeless</p>

<p>second beat…? interesting, kinda nice (just really wish it actually transitioned to the next song better)</p>

<h4>Shitsville</h4>

<p>those double syllables in the space of one will always sound so damn good:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And now my transmission leaking and my rear suspension squeaking<br/>Drop a rock off to my geeker, fix my shit man, I’m out here creeping<br/>Twist that shit but I’m out here tweaking for that 20 twin twin<br/>Kick that shit in ’95 while watching “Friday” with my friends</p>
</blockquote>

<p>god I underestimated Freddie, his lyrical flow genuinely seems unique and stylistically interesting (even if the topic of this song is completely and utterly stupid)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I stand on all ten toes, one dick and two nuts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I take it all back lmaooo</p>

<p>how does this sound so good though, even if the bars are so weird- LIKE DUDE THE BASS LINE</p>

<h4>Thuggin’</h4>

<p>god that chorus sounds so good, I love this sort of style that Madlib is genuinely perfect at</p>

<p>I don’t have much to say, this is just so well made, and Freddie is of course- bro why is there ANOTHER SECOND BEAT i mean i like it and it sounds really nice but it’s so out there</p>

<p>i love it :)</p>

<h4>Real</h4>

<p>that transition I like better, that was good ^</p>

<p>bro why is there another two balls dick and ten toes bar lol</p>

<p>woah… that last bar AND THE BASS</p>

<p>‘remember everybody ain’t loyal’ jesus christ, this is powerful</p>

<h4>Uno</h4>

<p>not sure this one has as much of a vibe I like as the others, but even if it’s not my favorite it still sounds so recognizable and so damn well-made</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fuck a diamond on your finger, I guess it’s the dog in me<br/>Ain’t no hog in me, I’m swine-free, tough as the Iron Sheik<br/>Nine G’s for the nine piece, how you define me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OOH that is toasty ^^</p>

<p>I kinda take it back, took a second to warm up but this is genuinely so good, especially the ending of that second verse…</p>

<h4>Robes (feat. Domo Genesis &amp; Earl Sweatshirt)</h4>

<p>I need to stop complimenting Madlib so much, but dude seriously- his sampling, instrumentation choices, and recognizable quality subtleties are so damn good</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel like one with the moon but that’s some other shit<br/>I stopped caring how people see me and I’m loving it<br/>But no desire for your input, I does my shit<br/>Say what you want but know my ignorance is fucking bliss</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is probably my favorite so far, both Genesis &amp; Earl’s features fit so well, the three of them together each have such different vocal subtleties and pitches that it feels like a sort of spectrum (that works so damn well)</p>

<p>bruh this second part just had to come in with the synth goat noises lmao</p>

<p>this is hilarious though, such a nice break with his commentary</p>

<p>do-do</p>

<h4>Broken (feat. Scarface)</h4>

<p>honestly this one doesn’t stick out much to me, in a way it slightly worries me that this record might drag out a bit? I know I’m gonna get proven wrong, it’s just a feeling</p>

<p>okay this Scarface feature is damn good though, I love how meaningful and personal each of these notable bars are</p>

<h4>Lakers (feat. Ab-Soul, Polyester the Saint)</h4>

<p>very very good start; that verse first stands out again, it’s so good leading into Polyester’s quality chorus</p>

<p>I wasn’t sure about that Ab-Soul verse at first but wow he finishes it off so cleanly, I love that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Been 20 years since the riots<br/>L.A. n––s keep it thorough, fuck keeping quiet<br/>Bitch it’s on in this war zone where we reside<br/>As I begin, let my sins wash away with the tide<br/>Who the fuck am I kidding? I done tried everything but dying<br/>Flirting with other places but this Cali bitch stay on my mind</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this feels so heartfelt with the chorus about LA, I do really love this track and how personable it is, even if you have no connection to LA specifically</p>

<h4>Knicks</h4>

<p>damn that’s a smooth transition, probably the best of the record so far ^</p>

<p>such a nice beat, and again Freddie just has such a satisfying style on every single track</p>

<h4>Shame (feat. BJ The Chicago Kid)</h4>

<p>god this is so slick, especially given the topic of the track</p>

<p>and that chorus sounds so smooth with the instrumental, BJ The Chicago Kid has such a satisfying voice</p>

<p>yea this record didn’t drop off at the end at all, this fits so damn well, and I love the vibe that this has been leading up to</p>

<h4>Watts (feat. Big Time Watts)</h4>

<p>haha I love that sample, and it fits this nice little interlude so well</p>

<p>it’s literally just the voicemail lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man fuck you, you bitch, I hate yo’ god damn guts, dick</p>
</blockquote>

<p>such a nice uncle :))</p>

<h4>Piñata (feat. Domo Genesis, G-Wiz, Casey Veggies, Sulaiman, Meechy Darko &amp; Mac Miller)</h4>

<p>ohhhh shit what is this beat, I’m scared</p>

<p>OH MY GOD that base at ‘primetime’ is so damn well-placed; real chest-moving type beat</p>

<p>I was kind of torn what was gonna be my favorite/best track on this record, and this just complicates it</p>

<p>G-Wiz’s verse is probably my favorite, surprisingly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the rain and the pain gon’ stop?<br/>Standing on the porch early, no shoes, selling blow in my socks<br/>And I was watching for the ghetto bird<br/>Ain’t got no money for college so all I know is how to sack and how to serve</p>
</blockquote>

<p>while I was caught off guard (not in the best way) by Casey Veggies’ verse, the increase in tone to get to Sulaiman’s is really good knowing the structure better</p>

<p>i’m sorry Meechy Darko’s verse is the low point</p>

<p>O’Doyle rules</p>

<p>what is this outro lmao, how is he running back and forth so quickly?</p>
