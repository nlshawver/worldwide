<h2>notes for january 14</h2>

<h1>Mezzanine by Massive Attack</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Angel</h4>

<p>going into this I have no expectations; I&#39;ve never heard this before, so I&#39;m blind to what this is exactly</p>

<p>I can tell you though that this introduction is incredible, the soundscape that&#39;s being formed with that bass line, these echoed vocals, and ooh that beat ^</p>

<p>dude that drop :O</p>

<p>I absolutely love the driving guitar riff and that stuttering drum beat capped off by the snare hit, this is literally just music to rob a bank to</p>

<p>jesus what an opening track, that was insane</p>

<h4>Risingson</h4>

<p>my god, that&#39;s another damn good groove to start this off</p>

<p>these vocal lines are really impressive too, they sound so perfect alongside this instrumental</p>

<p>god those &quot;dream on&quot; lines that fades at the end of 3D&#39;s verses are so good :)</p>

<h4>Teardrop</h4>

<p>that&#39;s another really good beat introduction with that harpsichord; this is already so stellar for this type of record- and I was not expecting those vocals :O</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know what to say, that&#39;s just a really good track in my eyes, the instrumentals on this thing are already stunning</p>

<h4>Inertia Creeps</h4>

<p>ooh, I was not expecting those open snare hits with the warped and squirming sort of bass line</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can&#39;t endure, then you can&#39;t inhale clearly<br/>Out of body experience interferes<br/>And dreams of flying, I fit nearly<br/>Surrounds me, though I get lonely slowly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>jesus these vocals feel so sinister and punching, I love this; and god that bass line sounds like it&#39;s out of a tron movie, I adore that kind of styling</p>

<h4>Exchange</h4>

<p>that&#39;s a nice soothing instrumental introduction– and wow that supple, analog-ish bass line is rly good</p>

<p>a nice little instrumental break, I like that :)</p>

<h4>Dissolved Girl</h4>

<p>this track doesn&#39;t stand out to me a ton as of right now- but after that first chorus and that explosiveness, that does pick it up for me a bit ^</p>

<p>okay I eat my words, the instrumental after that slaps, I love that beat :O</p>

<p>and the chorus in itself is rly good too, idk why I was being so critical about it before lol</p>

<p>this was really good ^</p>

<h4>Man Next Door</h4>

<p>god that drum style is never gonna get old :)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not blown away by the vocals all that much in this one, but it does fit and towards the end of the verse the energy meshes much better imo</p>

<p>and I do rly like the way that fades out too ^</p>

<h4>Black Milk</h4>

<p>god just another fantastic bass riff to go along with these dreamy vocals :)</p>

<p>same singer as on Teardrop, Elizabeth Fraser- and while I’ll need to listen to both of them again I do think I like this track a bit more</p>

<p>both are really damn good of course, but still</p>

<h4>Mezzanine</h4>

<p>ooh I love how faded and echoed this instrumental is; and those low-pitched vocal lines are a great thematic choice too, sounds like a response back and forth :)</p>

<p>damn that’s such an aggressive tone, for a title track on this tail end of the record that’s a surprisingly good shift ^</p>

<h4>Group Four</h4>

<p>ooh weird, this is a hypnotic type of beat- and the vocals are as expected from this record (but that doesn&#39;t make Elizabeth Fraser&#39;s vocals any less beautiful)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ready to sing<br/>My sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath<br/>And listening<br/>Keeps me from my hurt<br/>My ears know that my eyes are closed<br/>Perished thoughts like contraband</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that is a very cryptic and lovely chorus, so nice ^</p>

<p>ah and that long break between the fourth verse and Fraser&#39;s outro is so good, especially when that outro begins with the driving bass line through the whole thing</p>

<h4>(Exchange)</h4>

<p>I do kinda like the revisiting of this track with vocals, I just think it being the full song yet again makes this record feel a bit dragged out; I had those thoughts earlier, where the tracks become just a hint too long, and the whole thing sort of gets lost in its own energy</p>

<p>thank god that energy is really damn good</p>

<p>but yea anyways this track is pretty good, I am actually appreciating more his vocals on this, it&#39;s charming almost</p>
