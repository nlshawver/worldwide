<h2>notes for january 13</h2>

<h1>self-titled (blue) by Weezer</h1>

<hr />

<h4>My Name Is Jonas</h4>

<p>okay we all already know this</p>

<p>this song is such a classic, and that second verse… OOH</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My name is Wepeel, got a box full of your toys<br/>They&#39;re fresh out of batteries, but they&#39;re still making noise</p>
</blockquote>

<p>god everything just fits so snugly, it’s all so well-done; the entire instrumental at the outro is amazingly bombastic, with a soothing acoustic ending</p>

<h4>No One Else</h4>

<p>this song is absolutely ridiculous, and it fits exactly the type of energy you see on the album cover :)</p>

<p>it’s like exactly what a thirteen year old thinks about romance; it’s so pleasingly outrageous and bombastic, it’s not even a popular song of the album and it’s such a damn catchy and well-made satirical ballad</p>

<h4>The World Has Turned and Left Me Here</h4>

<p>god and I love the meaning behind the last two songs: this guy was just being so blatantly sexist and awful, and this song is just about the girl breaking up with him because of it, and him wondering why lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I talked for hours to your wallet photograph<br/>And you just listened<br/>You laughed, enchanted by my intellect<br/>Or maybe you didn&#39;t</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is the best verse on this record so far, i love this ^</p>

<p>and my god what an earworm, everything on this record is so beautifully done you just can’t forget any of the energy shown</p>

<p>another amazing outro, right into:</p>

<h4>Buddy Holly</h4>

<p>WEEE OOOOH</p>

<p>oh my god this song- that synth/string whatever right before the second verse is absolutely amazing on such an amazing track</p>

<p>OH OH</p>

<p>this might be absolutely the best Weezer song to scream your heart at to; it’s just absolute alt rock perfection, everything meshes and molds right together into this masterpiece</p>

<p>and you cannot tell me that guitar break is not absolute FIRE</p>

<h4>Undone (The Sweater Song)</h4>

<p>and we’re right into another classic, and I think the perfect downtempo transition from Buddy Holly</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to destroy my sweater<br/>Hold this thread as I walk away<br/>Watch me unravel, I&#39;ll soon be naked<br/>Lying on the floor, lying on the floor, I&#39;ve come undone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this chorus is absolutely stunning, I can’t stop just loving every second of this thing</p>

<p>I’ll stop bringing them, but seriously these instrumentals are so damn good; and that final quiet, unsettling outro is such a nice, weird break :O</p>

<h4>Surf Wax America</h4>

<p>this album is classic after classic, my god</p>

<p>that’s such a minimalist, marching chorus that just meshes so well with Rivers’s vocals and the furious guitars alongside him</p>

<p>and MY GOD that acapella chorus with a bit of an aggressive undertone right at the end- right into this AMAZING instrumental is fantastic</p>

<h4>Say It Ain’t So</h4>

<p>but then you get this absolute masterpiece, so…</p>

<p>god, I don’t think I need to say anything about this track, everyone knows everything about what makes this such a stunning master-class of alt rock</p>

<p>with how smooth and silky the rest of the track is, and that small guitar solo after the first chorus, all the choruses just feel absolutely crushing :O</p>

<p>AHHHHH THE GUITAR IN THE CHORUS</p>

<p>from the second chorus to the end of the song is quite possibly the best two minutes of music I have ever heard</p>

<p>and my lord the meaning of this song is absolutely heartbreaking, five out of five</p>

<h4>In the Garage</h4>

<p>I don’t know how you can come down from the last track, but seriously this might be the best way- it’s like an escape from the pain of the last track</p>

<p>the repetition of the verses fits exactly right with the tone of the track; I like that a lot, and my god the bass on the third verse is so strong under the vocals</p>

<p>and a fantastic little guitar solo yet again ^</p>

<h4>Holiday</h4>

<p>god I love how this just feels like a victory lap (and it pretty much is, since this and In the Garage were made right after their signing of a record deal)</p>

<p>and I really, really like how simplistic and emotive that short little chorus is :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(On the road with Kerouac)<br/>We will write a postcard to our<br/>(Sheltered in his bivouac)<br/>Friends and family in free verse<br/>(On this road, we&#39;ll never die)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I absolutely love this bridge; and my god if the rest of this song just feels so stunningly excited- and AH that second-long guitar break :D</p>

<h4>Only in Dreams</h4>

<p>this is the perfect track to cap off a perfect record in my eyes; the slowly introduced instrumental is and always will be a classic, and the lyrical style and intonation is so smooth :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only in dreams, we see what it means<br/>Reach out our hands, hold onto hers<br/>But when we wake, it&#39;s all been erased<br/>And so it seems, only in dreams</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is a lovely chorus ^</p>

<p>and honestly that second verse is even more stunning, it feels so soulful and it just slowly builds right back into that marching chorus; this outro may be long but all the instrumentals and incredible, and the build-up is so damn amazing</p>

<p>yea this absolutely does feel like the perfect end for a nerd album: he doesn’t get the girl :(</p>
