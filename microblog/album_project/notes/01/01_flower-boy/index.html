<h2>notes for january 1</h2>

<h1>Flower Boy by Tyler, The Creator</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Foreword (feat. Rex Orange County)</h4>

<p>this is a really nice opener, seems to be a good tone-setter</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many chains can I wear ’til I’m considered a slave?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rex’s vocal lines are a really nice pairing, especially with this instrumental</p>

<p>those blown-out, warped synths at the end are a weird but thematic sort of addition</p>

<h4>Where This Flower Blooms (feat. Frank Ocean)</h4>

<p>Frank Ocean’s chorus to the beat drop and Tyler’s post-chorus is incredible</p>

<p>verse 2 is fire as hell</p>

<p>it’s interesting how Frank’s vocals fade in so blatantly, but it’s kinda nice in a way</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Took a lil’ while, n—— makin’ leaves<br/>Keep it in my branches so my family can eat</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Sometimes…</h4>

<p>that subtle transition to this song is really nice</p>

<p>Wyatt Navarro’s line is really damn good, especially how it goes right into See You Again</p>

<h4>See You Again (feat. Kali Uchis)</h4>

<p>Kali Uchis is incredible on this track, the way she finished the chorus is absolutely amazing</p>

<p>that beat drop is so hot, gets me every time</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I’d give up my bakery to have a piece of your piece<br/>Ugh!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i love it :)</p>

<h4>Who Dat Boy (feat. A$AP Rocky)</h4>

<p>that synth transition right from See You Again is honestly kinda weird at first</p>

<p>I honestly don’t know whether this is incredible or just kind of alright</p>

<p>A$AP Rocky’s chorus to verse is pretty good imo</p>

<p>yea the verses in general are actually really good, it’s just the contrast of the chorus-</p>

<p>holy shit that ending :O</p>

<h4>Pothole (feat. Jaden Smith)</h4>

<p>smooth transition, the drums in this sound really good with the weird high-pitched synths</p>

<p>Tyler’s verses here are good (especially the second), the chorus just seems too simplistic in a way, even if it shows off the verses better— like the verses become the stand out part, with the chorus not being a clear resolve or ‘home’ in music theory b.s.</p>

<p>okay actually Jaden’s chorus isn’t that bad, it’s just not the clear better part of the song (the start is good tho)</p>

<h4>Garden Shed (feat. Estelle)</h4>

<p>I like that synth intro, with the distorted guitar coming in</p>

<p>the instruments coming together with Estelle, and Tyler’s minimal verse sound so nice together</p>

<p>this is a sleeper track on this record, no doubt</p>

<p>like the punchy parts are just perfectly -almost- blown out, so it just sounds amazing when it swaps in between that and the quiet pieces</p>

<p>and then Tyler comes in with fire again, I love his ending verse</p>

<p>if Boredom is the clear top track, garden shed is an almost perfect introduction and lead into it</p>

<h4>Boredom (feat. Rex Orange County &amp; Anna of the North)</h4>

<p>smooth as butter transition; Rex (and of course Corinne &amp; Anna) coming through with a classic</p>

<p>this shit is SO good—</p>

<p>goosebumps at Rex’s chorus</p>

<p>TYLER’S VERSES GO SO HARD</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What the fuck is the problem? Is it me?<br/>‘Cause I’m not solved, I’m… bored</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this song really is the climax of this record, I love it so much</p>

<p>the final chorus is literally like home, it feels so good to hear</p>

<p>the strings are the bop of this whole outro, they compliment everything else and everyone else’s lines so well</p>

<p>pretty much perfect outro piece with Rex’s pitched down vocals</p>

<h4>I Ain’t Got Time!</h4>

<p>woah, those saw synths into mad Tyler is way more powerful than I was expecting</p>

<p>that verse 2 start is… damn</p>

<p>THE BEAT CHANGE TO THE BRIDGE :O</p>

<p>AND THE THIRD VERSE</p>

<p>these three tracks in a row are so damn good</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is so stupid but it fits so well, I love it :D</p>

<h4>911 / Mr. Lonely (feat. Frank Ocean &amp; Steve Lacy)</h4>

<p>the flow of this record is by far the best part of it imo, everything fits perfectly even if each song has its own distinct energy and thematic pieces</p>

<p>shit I was not expecting Steve Lacy on this, that chorus is so mf good with the synths at the end</p>

<p>I like Frank’s callback in his verse :)</p>

<p>damn Tyler’s third verse</p>

<p>that middle transition is kinda shocking, and idk if it’s in the best way- but Tyler’s following verse fits well so I’ll allow it</p>

<p>DAMN</p>

<p>that last verse line with Jasper’s OH is really good</p>

<h4>Droppin’ Seeds (feat. Lil Wayne)</h4>

<p>what the f—</p>

<p>what is weezy doing here</p>

<p>help</p>

<p>why is it so good</p>

<p>that was surprising, in a good way; nice interlude</p>

<h4>November</h4>

<p>holy- this verse is written so well, it’s stunningly impressive to me</p>

<p>the wordplay is so good, and I love this (even though it’s kinda obvious):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if my music too weird for the masses?<br/>And I’m only known for tweets more than beats or<br/>All my day-ones turn to three, fours ‘cause of track seven</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that whole section is so genius, I think with all of these last few tracks, this record is his best work</p>

<p>DAMN that transition to that final verse :O</p>

<h4>Glitter</h4>

<p>idk how I feel about Tyler’s pitched up vocals, but it honestly shifted a bit and it fits surprisingly well with the instrumental</p>

<p>I like this one, especially with the second part of november being pretty much an introduction to this one</p>

<p>and right when I think that, deep Tyler</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I see you, my heart beat change tempo</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that double entendre ^^^</p>

<p>damn</p>

<p>this record is so good</p>

<h4>Enjoy Right Now, Today</h4>

<p>this is such a good ending, my god</p>

<p>the car door on both the opener and closer, the only closer being instrumentals and voice samples— it sounds like a march forward perfectly, even before the beat changes with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One, two, three, four</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love how it basically gives you time to think- for a while… and then, it’s over.</p>

<p>yea, easily his best record (so far; I need to re-listen to Wolf, IGOR, and CMIYGL)</p>

<p>this is a such a high note and a great start, absolutely loving it :)</p>
