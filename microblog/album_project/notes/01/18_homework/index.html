<h2>notes for january 18</h2>

<h1>Homework by Daft Punk</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Daftendirekt</h4>

<p>ooh that’s a funky cadence :)</p>

<p>I’m not really sure what I’m going to think of this, given I know the least about this era of Daft Punk</p>

<p>I was starting to get worried about this track, and when the drums and that screeching cymbal come in it kinda peaks- but this is just the opening track, and that groove is really nice</p>

<h4>WDPK 83.7 FM</h4>

<p>nice transition ^^</p>

<p>haha I love that introduction, that’s pretty nice</p>

<h4>Revolution 909</h4>

<p>that’s a nice little interlude before the beat, which is way more shrill than I was expecting- but the bass kinda carries this imo</p>

<p>the little downturn into the beat again was nice though, and this is a good beat for sure, I’m just not completely sold</p>

<p>ooh and that blatant stutter in the beat at the very end is rly nice, but my point still stands that it just feels a little bland</p>

<h4>Da Funk</h4>

<p>but ooh this introduction is stellar already, what the hell</p>

<p>OHHH SHIT this beat :O</p>

<p>and my god that reintroduction of all the parts of the beat at around the halfway mark of the track is wonderful :))</p>

<p>that was really damn good, I just hope the rest of the tracklist supports that clear high point with that driving sample</p>

<h4>Phœnix</h4>

<p>I’m not gonna lie this isn’t doing it for me so far</p>

<p>yea that bass line that comes in at the middle was the most surprising thing on this track</p>

<p>I think this track does kinda grow on me though, it just might be too lightweight of a track to truly be special to my ears</p>

<h4>Fresh</h4>

<p>ooh okay, this is a better start compared to the last track, I’m liking this steady, warbling overtone with this flowing and receding beat</p>

<p>and that’s a nice fade-out; I find the instrumentation on that much more appealing than on Phœnix, while being much more brief</p>

<h4>Around the World</h4>

<p>okay okay, this is another funky start, good stuff :)</p>

<p>hahaha I love the wikipedia page for this song:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The song&#39;s only lyrics are &quot;around the world,&quot; said 144 times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think this has nearly the prestige and overall lovely aesthetic of Da Funk, but this is certainly a jam ^</p>

<h4>Rollin’ &amp; Scratchin’</h4>

<p>okay, I don’t know if it’s just me but I can only mesh with some tracks on this record; this is not one of them</p>

<p>like I appreciate the instrumentation and the wild, screeching synths, but it just doesn’t constitute much of the praise that I’d give the other two/three tracks that I think have more merit</p>

<p>this might be the most adventurous track so far though, so I give it credit there, since it’s at least interesting- I just think it might overstate its welcome in spite of that</p>

<p>okay that outro was nice though, I liked that given the track’s context</p>

<h4>Teachers</h4>

<p>ooh wow okay, this is an interesting, weird sort of track</p>

<p>I think it might have stayed a bit too long, but it was a worthwhile break</p>

<h4>High Fidelity</h4>

<p>I do like the increased amount of samples on this track as opposed to their very tame use on the opening half of this record- but I think it more so shows the rest of this record as being less adventurous than it could have been</p>

<p>the second half of this track is I think the peak of it, and it’s a genuinely really good deep cut on this album</p>

<h4>Rock’n Roll</h4>

<p>yea, not a huge fan of the beat in this context yet, but those grossly distorted synths punching in and out are a nice addition; this is definitely not a high point to me though</p>

<p>that drum beat introduction is good tho, this is getting interesting</p>

<p>it’s just completely ridiculous, I don’t know- it’s not halfway through and I’m already sick of it</p>

<p>it just for too long walks the line between incredibly driving and catchy, and mind-numbingly frustrating- so it’s just gross after so long :(</p>

<h4>Oh Yeah</h4>

<p>that’s actually a catchy, punchy, interesting interlude, so a nice break from the previous track ^</p>

<h4>Burnin’</h4>

<p>okay this is actually a pretty good start, but I think those zipper-esque noises are just weird- and it just keeps going</p>

<p>like when they go away the beat sounds so transcendent and beautiful, but then they come back and just want to tear my ears off</p>

<p>LIKE AHH the beat is so damn good, but that noise is just disgusting- and that little bass melody they throw in is so good</p>

<p>this song genuinely makes me angry</p>

<h4>Indo Silver Club</h4>

<p>and another good start, I really like this weird cadence to the groove, it’s done really well</p>

<p>unlike Burnin’ that weird synth guitar actually works really well, and isn’t just absolutely grating; it adds to the aesthetic so well imo ^</p>

<p>OHHH shit yea this song absolutely slaps- lovely ending too :)</p>

<h4>Alive</h4>

<p>creepy lil intro; bass and drum intro sounding really spacious and well made</p>

<p>that was honestly really good, might be one of the top tracks on this album because of how well it mixes together the instrumentation ^</p>

<h4>Funk Ad</h4>

<p>ooh, weird little backwards interlude :O</p>

<p>okay, that’s all</p>
