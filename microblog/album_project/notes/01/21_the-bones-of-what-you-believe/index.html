<h2>notes for january 21</h2>

<h1>The Bones of What You Believe by CHVRCHΞS</h1>

<hr />

<h4>The Mother We Share</h4>

<p>ooh okay, I was really worried for this track at the onset, but the actual beat and vocals relieved me a lot</p>

<p>I do really like this aesthetic, I think it has a lot of personality and merit behind it especially given those soaring synth lines ^^</p>

<p>god I love that ending chorus, that’s absolutely stellar :O</p>

<h4>We Sink</h4>

<p>I thought the instrumental was a little derivative at first, but god the crunchiness of that bass is amazing</p>

<p>and jesus that chorus was surprisingly good, and the shimmering instrumentation is a really neat thematic choice</p>

<p>I think it does get a bit repetitive but it’s rly well made imo</p>

<h4>Gun</h4>

<p>god this start is a groove and a half</p>

<p>AHHHHH THAT PRE-CHORUS TO THE CHORUS</p>

<p>I don’t know how or why I had such a jaw-dropping reaction to that but jesus christ that’s such a playfully toned, incredibly punchy part of this track</p>

<p>absolutely fantastic track, and the choice of having it fade out is always a nice choice imo</p>

<h4>Tether</h4>

<p>and that’s a really nice and much more mellow introduction, I like the very pulsating synth lines :)</p>

<p>my lord that interlude is absolutely mesmerizing, I’m adoring this ^^</p>

<p>another extremely solid track, this is a very strong first four</p>

<h4>Lies</h4>

<p>god that’s such a unique sounding instrumental behind this track, I’m adoring the energy of this record so much</p>

<p>and ooh that last chorus is so wonderfully punchy; I have very little to say just because I feel at a loss for words at how unique, crushing, and absolutely lovely these synths are :)</p>

<h4>Under the Tide</h4>

<p>okay okay, I thought this was gonna be kind of a sleepy track, but the second chorus convinced me that this is just an overall good track, it’s just not nearly as standout as the opening- five songs</p>

<p>those two high, melodic synths really add to this though, I think it just comes together well on the backend</p>

<p>so I guess it just got better as I went along- especially with those incredibly warped drums :O</p>

<h4>Recover</h4>

<p>I think honestly the verses of this thing shine the most, some of the instrumentation isn’t getting to me, but there’s enough to it that I do like it a good amount</p>

<p>I feel like this is the actual slight downturn even if the chorus and post-chorus is done really well- it just feels like camouflage in the midst of this record</p>

<p>well okay I say that but these backend recoveries and emotional leaps are really getting to me ^^</p>

<p>nvm wth how does this record not dip at all yet?</p>

<h4>Night Sky</h4>

<p>okay I really liked the verse, but my GOD that chorus is so damn good :D</p>

<p>this is probably one of my top three tracks so far, and I love the little 808 noise? I don’t really know what it is, but it’s like a plucky drum</p>

<p>jesus this song is absolutely stunning with the soaring vocals :)</p>

<p>and that ending is scampering along, I like that thematic choice given the rest of the track</p>

<h4>Science/Visions</h4>

<p>and that’s a rly good transition into this RLY nice arpeggio :O</p>

<p>absolutely lovely bass line, I like that a lot ^^</p>

<p>I’m going to be honest, that chorus might be my favorite on the whole record so far, that’s so lovely :)</p>

<p>I guess it helps that the instrumental is an absolute mf BANGER too my god</p>

<h4>Lungs</h4>

<p>this is yet again another track I was initially put off by, but the chorus sounds as close to introspective &amp; mellow as this thing gets</p>

<p>and that absolutely crushing, crunchy bass, I adore that ^</p>

<p>you can bite it, wth :O</p>

<h4>By The Throat</h4>

<p>yep this is the theme of this record- slight unease about the thematic choices, like the stereotypical electronic clapping leading to the chorus</p>

<p>but DUDE MY GOD that sparkling aesthetic of the chorus is such a trip, this might be my favorite track :D</p>

<p>such a wonderful energy to the track, and it’s not grossly slick or anything close to it; yea this is the definite favorite, such a soaring anthem :)</p>

<h4>You Caught the Light</h4>

<p>I do really appreciate how this record ends, actually giving a sort of conclusion to the mayhem of the previous eleven tracks- especially given the last definitely felt like the album’s peak</p>

<p>absolutely lovely album from start to finish, I’m so glad I included this thing :)</p>
