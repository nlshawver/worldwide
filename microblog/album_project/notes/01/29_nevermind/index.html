<h2>notes for january 29</h2>

<h1>Nevermind by Nirvana</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Smells Like Teen Spirit</h4>

<p>damn this opener, what the hell :O</p>

<p>this track might be played too much, but at least it’s an incredible track; this is so mf good ^^</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the lights out, it&#39;s less dangerous<br/>Here we are now, entertain us<br/>I feel stupid and contagious<br/>Here we are now, entertain us<br/>A mulatto, an albino<br/>A mosquito, my libido</p>
</blockquote>

<p>every single instrument just does such an incredible job, and Cobain’s vocals fit wonderfully with the attitude of the track; genuine masterpiece of an opener, and such a mood-setter for the record</p>

<h4>In Bloom</h4>

<p>god that guitar melody right before the verse is such a catchy opener- and THAT BASS LINE :O</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can have some more<br/>Nature is a whore<br/>Bruises on the fruit<br/>Tender age in bloom</p>
</blockquote>

<p>what an incredible and brutally meaningful verse right into the aggression of the chorus—</p>

<p>I don’t know how you can have a record brimming with classics with this much of a unique energy, it’s legitimately magnificent</p>

<h4>Come as You Are</h4>

<p>this is just proving that point- another instantly recognizable track with the warbled, creepily meandering bass; brilliant three opening tracks, my god</p>

<p>I don’t have much else to say about this track that hasn’t already been said about the last two, it’s useless to try and encapsulate energy put forth</p>

<h4>Breed</h4>

<p>holy shit :O</p>

<p>I’m sorry those bass and guitar lines are just jaw-dropping, I don’t know what to say- AHHH WTF THE SOLO</p>

<p>this thing is impossible to describe; this is as masterful and iconic as Illmatic is for its own genre (and music as a whole)</p>

<h4>Lithium</h4>

<p>I love the temporary pull-back in terms of energy, but it just delves right back in the dredges with the chorus and its theme</p>

<p>I can’t keep saying everything is amazing and incredible with different words; I think no matter what you know this record is a masterpiece</p>

<h4>Polly</h4>

<p>the way this track genuinely pulls back now with this acoustic melody is lovely, and it just adds to the wonderful pacing of the record :)</p>

<p>that chorus and its cadence is incredibly well done, it sticks out the most in this progression (in a good way, of course)</p>

<h4>Territorial Pissings</h4>

<p>jesus what a crushing theme and a brutal instrumental and vocal tonality to go with it; just looking at the meaning behind this track is so moving, and this is in the midst of quite possibly the most moving record of the past half-century</p>

<h4>Drain You</h4>

<p>honestly this is the only track that feels like a continuation of old themes on the record- but even then the dorky meaning of the song makes it unique and special on its own ^^</p>

<h4>Lounge Act</h4>

<p>I think the track name perfectly encapsulates the energy of this track- this is the closest thing to a grunge/alt-rock track made on top of an elevator music melody</p>

<p>damn what a perfectly unique and mind-altering ending :O</p>

<h4>Stay Sway</h4>

<p>I’m glad I only know a few tracks on this record, I think it makes the experience of the back-end of this record so much better</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Monkey see, monkey do (I don&#39;t know why)<br/>Rather be dead than cool (I don&#39;t know why)<br/>Every line ends in rhyme (I don&#39;t know why)<br/>Less is more, love is blind (I don&#39;t know why)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>jesus christ what an expressive, knotty ending; that was incredible as always :O</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God is gay</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>On a Plain</h4>

<p>I adore that bridge, that’s such a fantastically well-articulated break in the track- and the comeback to the verse is wonderful :)</p>

<p>this is a perfect, interestingly unique and colorful deep cut on this record ^</p>

<p>god and those ending vocals are lovely and soothing ^^</p>

<h4>Something in the Way</h4>

<p>what a haunting track, I can’t accurately describe the feeling garnered from this, so you’ll just have to listen for yourself</p>

<p>which is something you should do regardless, this record deserves every single second of its runtime</p>

<h4>Endless, Nameless</h4>

<p>this is an absolutely brutal and crushing end to the tracklist, and just completely topples the expectations of the ending on Something in the Way</p>

<p>no more words are needed, you know you should listen to this again</p>
