<h2>notes for january 5</h2>

<h1>Turn On The Bright Lights by Interpol</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Untitled</h4>

<p>ooh alright, I like this instrumental :)</p>

<p>I do like this intro where the actual vocal segment takes up so little time, but it’s still integral to the feel/attitude of the song</p>

<p>that fade out is really good too</p>

<h4>Obstacle 1</h4>

<p>another really good instrumental, with the short guitar riffs– but the vocal lines are way punchier than I was expecting, and in a great kind of way</p>

<p>this is actually really good, I’m not a huge fan anymore of this alternative sound but it’s still composed surprisingly well- and while I think some of the vocal lines could be more powerful, I think the expression in them is more than enough to make them fit perfectly in with the sound</p>

<h4>NYC</h4>

<p>honestly wasn’t expecting this change in energy so quickly, but I love this first verse and chorus, along with of course its meaning</p>

<p>wow… the instrumental after the second verse and leading into the bridge is done so damn well</p>

<p>this might be my favorite so far, I love this style and expression</p>

<h4>PDA</h4>

<p>alright another tonal shift :O</p>

<p>I was unsure of this track at first, but honestly after the first chorus and the start of the second verse I think it’s pretty alright</p>

<p>yea still unsure about that chorus, just with his vocal intonation</p>

<p>this guitar instrumental right after seems to fit really well though, I like this a lot; and that is a damn good outro too</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Something to say<br/>Something to do<br/>Nothing to say<br/>When there’s nothing to do</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Say Hello to the Angels</h4>

<p>damn good instrumental lead up ^^</p>

<p>alright I can see why it fits so well, the meaning of this track certainly fits with the feel of it lol</p>

<p>okay okay, this pre-chorus is surprisingly good, and there are some really good instrumentals around here- LIKE THAT BASS</p>

<p>this is currently tied with NYC, I like both of them for completely different reasons</p>

<h4>Hands Away</h4>

<p>okay then, compelling start—</p>

<p>alright the drawn out chords/strings that play when the drums come in faster are a very good fit, I like this a lot</p>

<p>the song kinda goes nowhere with this tho, but that seems to fit the energy of the song anyways</p>

<h4>Obstacle 2</h4>

<p>I really like the start of this again, the second verse sold me on this one</p>

<p>honestly kinda like this more than Obstacle 1, that was surprisingly good given the sort of weird energy/theme on this album as a whole</p>

<h4>Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down</h4>

<p>okay it seems like Interpol are really good at giving a similar start or theme to their tracks, but there’s always one thing that keeps them separate from each other- on this, I love the kind of staccato, pausing drum beat at the pre-chorus</p>

<p>I think the chorus is honestly pretty weak at the start, but the ending of it right into the break (before the bridge) is really good in my opinion</p>

<p>I don’t know, maybe the grimy, imperfect aesthetic just isn’t reaching me on this one; I can recognize that this is pretty good, it’s just not meshing with me much at the moment</p>

<p>but even then, there are bits and pieces that stand out a lot to me, like the style of the break- I just can’t get over how I don’t really like the chorus all that much rn</p>

<p>this outro is good though, I genuinely like this part</p>

<h4>Roland</h4>

<p>this is another really damn good introduction, I love this style</p>

<p>but seriously, I just can’t get as much into the vocals- the chorus is good but the verse just sets me off a bit</p>

<p>and then it just happens again :/</p>

<p>I don’t know man, the ending is alright, I think this is just my weak point on the record</p>

<h4>The New</h4>

<p>all of these introductions are so good, I just sometimes can’t mesh with the vocal themes and choices all that much I guess</p>

<p>this is a sort of exception though, this sounds really good so far</p>

<p>yes definitely, this pre-chorus is a jam :)</p>

<h4>Leif Erikson</h4>

<p>okay this was surprisingly good; I seem to like their songs more so when Banks’s voice isn’t so strained, and he’s able to emote more with lower intonation- or maybe I’m spitballing, I don’t really know myself</p>

<p>but this was very good; I think this, NYC, Obstacle 2, and The New are my clear favorites</p>
