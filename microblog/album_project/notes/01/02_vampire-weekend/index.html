<h2>notes for january 2</h2>

<h1>self-titled by Vampire Weekend</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Mansard Roof</h4>

<p>I like the punchiness of the instrumental</p>

<p>and wow those wind instruments right alongside the guitar- and especially leading into the chorus, I love those</p>

<p>I really like the energy, it seems like a good opener to what I’m thinking this is gonna be like</p>

<h4>Oxford Comma</h4>

<p>haha I love the way this starts :)</p>

<p>damn the second chorus is so good, I actually really like this</p>

<p>dude what in the hell is the lil jon bar at the end lmao</p>

<p>nice little guitar riff ^</p>

<p>BONGOS</p>

<p>^ thank god I have good headphones, those bongos are sitting to my left</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would you tape my conversations?<br/>Show your paintings at the United Nations<br/>Lil Jon, he always tells the truth</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>A-Punk</h4>

<p>YOO I KNOW THIS ONE :D</p>

<p>I do really like this though, the combination of Oxford Comma right into this is a great duo</p>

<p>also these lyrics are really interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His Honor drove southward, seeking erotica<br/>Down to the pueblo huts of New Mexico<br/>Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that last line reminds me of something you’d see Beck say in some random song in 2001</p>

<p>overall really nice, this energy is so nice</p>

<h4>Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa</h4>

<p>woah I really like that first verse :)</p>

<p>haha that chorus is so calmly chaotic, right into the sorta chill, off-kilter post-chorus</p>

<p>this might be my favorite so far, I love it and how it sounds exactly like a bedroom feels</p>

<h4>M79</h4>

<p>woah that intro is kinda weird, the sound contrast and instrument choice is kinda wack; just unique</p>

<p>but I do like when the vocals come in, that second verse is probably the high point imo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You walk up the stairs, see the French kids by the door<br/>Up one more flight, see the Buddha on the second floor<br/>Coronation rickshaw grab</p>
</blockquote>

<p>honestly not so sure about the instrumental towards the back-end, maybe just not my favorite</p>

<p>it does have a nice energy though, so the uniqueness (and difference in contrast from the other tracks) makes up for that</p>

<p>ooh yea the strings at the very end after the short instrumental are really good</p>

<h4>Campus</h4>

<p>okay this is catchy as all hell</p>

<p>I love how compacted and to the point that first verse and chorus are, that’s nice</p>

<p>small banger, basically :)</p>

<p>that slightly overblown base line fits so well with this track ^</p>

<p>ohhh especially with the crescendo into the drums and last bridge/chorus, then that tiny guitar solo lol</p>

<h4>Bryn</h4>

<p>that’s a nice rhythm at the onset of this, I like that :)</p>

<p>ooooh yea this is my favorite so far, the chorus is just so nice, and it’s such a nice short song</p>

<p>layered vocals at the end of verse 2 and chorus, good choice with Ezra’s voice and this melody</p>

<h4>One (Blake’s Got a New Face)</h4>

<p>okay that crash cymbal sounded dumb imo, but the rest of this rhythm and the playful synths sound so good</p>

<p>haha the chorus (and whole song) sounds like if Adventure Time was a genre</p>

<p>the verses in this album are genuinely really nice though, the references and specificity are really nice</p>

<p>I like how the instrument choices and instrumentals in general sound so deliberate, like they never included anything that was even slightly overbearing—it’s a nice kind of cooldown, and I like that a lot (even if it is just so simplistic)</p>

<h4>I Stand Corrected</h4>

<p>okay okay, this starts really well</p>

<p>woah, those backwards keyboard notes are a neat addition</p>

<p>this is the most exciting song on the record so far, and it seems to suit this style really well, I really like the baseline with the loud drums</p>

<p>such a brief ending, that’s good</p>

<h4>Walcott</h4>

<p>those keys/guitar hit really well, great introduction to this one :)</p>

<p>bro the switch up for the second verse is another highlight, that’s good</p>

<p>AH that bridge goes so hard into the instrumental</p>

<p>yea that outro gets going so well, and it sounds like a culmination of all of the possible energy Ezra has (it’s not much)</p>

<p>bro please hit that final note PLEASE</p>

<h4>The Kids Don’t Stand A Chance</h4>

<p>this is a good start to outro track though, despite committing an act of treachery by not hitting that final note on Walcott</p>

<p>NO NOT THE PLANTS &gt;:(</p>

<p>that harpsichord though</p>

<p>I think Bryn-onward is when this record is at a high point, I just honestly think the first few tracks can blend together (besides maybe A-Punk)</p>

<p>the fade out was also a really good choice, especially since the melody intentionally overpowers the other instruments and it ends so well</p>
