<h1>mini notes for run the jewels</h1>

<ul>
	<li>what a stellar introduction to this superduo… that bombastic instrumental behind some truly chaotic bars and schemes are absolutely amazing :D</li>
	<li>the ending of mike’s verse on banana clipper was amazing, and the lead into big boi’s verse (and ofc his verse in general) was great; just good stuff overall</li>
	<li>AHHH mike’s verse that starts 36” chain is INCREDIBLE- best verse on here so far imo :))

		<ul>
			<li>ooh and those outro bars from both of them was a good cap to this cut ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the HUGE beat of the next track DDFH right after is so damn heavy and incessantly catchy :O

		<ul>
			<li>the little breakdown drum beat in the middle of el’s verse is such an earworm too :o</li>
			<li>this has the best beat imo, so mf tasty ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>SEA LEGS OH MY GOD; el-p’s verse is just so menacing, everything there is just jaw-dropping…</li>
	<li>and mike sounds so hungry on job well done—his almost husky, broken inflection adds so much to these hugely profound bars :O

		<ul>
			<li>the mf dolphin lmaooo</li>
			<li>the chorus from until the ribbon breaks ties this cut together really well; might be the best part that keeps this feel at least a bit sane in its nature ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I like a lot of the elements of no come down, that chorus especially; while repetitive, it feels so fitting for a track with this aesthetic

		<ul>
			<li>not my favorite, but not a bad cut at all ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy moly, get it has yet again another incredible beat behind hypnotizing bars; killer mike’s second verse especially is absolutely amazing :O

		<ul>
			<li>the follow-up trade offs after that break are amazing too; the insane rumbling bass kicks towards the end of each discrete bit of the track are insane :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that tourette’s line is completely stupid and I love it :))

		<ul>
			<li>jesus christ the last two verses from mike and el-p respectively are just showered in overt swagger and braggadocious lines… I don’t know how it’s so appealing, but this is hitting all the right points very, very consistently</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>those huge, stretched-out bass and kicks for christmas fucking miracle are jaw-dropping yet again… I love this thing so damn much

		<ul>
			<li>the last few lines from el-p especially are a standout for me; killer mike’s ending and inspirational referencing of ice cube is yet another great line to complete this whole shocking experience of an LP</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
