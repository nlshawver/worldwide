<h1>mini notes for igor</h1>

<ul>
	<li>thx moment :o

		<ul>
			<li>in all seriousness though, what an absolutely incredible introduction to this LP :O</li>
			<li>that insane beat, the piano, the strained vocals... everything combines together beautifully :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>perfect transition into the obviously most iconic song of the album- I&#39;ve heard &quot;true fans&quot; say it&#39;s not as good... but come on, this is insanely good :D

		<ul>
			<li>tyler&#39;s pitched vocals are honestly a really great part of this record, and contribute rly nicely to the aesthetic choices on the album :)</li>
			<li>carti not bad either ^^</li>
			<li>outro is one of the best parts too, lovely stuff :o</li>
			<li>~bass~</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn, another great transition; the crackles are a nice addition too :)

		<ul>
			<li>the theme of the track and the way tyler acts over this incessantly catchy beat is almost playful- the little moment before the long instrumental is lovely</li>
			<li>the pause right back into the female vocalist (bodiono nkono?) is amazing :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>hehe the tiny interlude into (and including) running out of time is rly soothing almost ^^</li>
	<li>letting the track grow and develop thematically with tyler&#39;s super-pitched vocals this time- before getting into the subtly punchy beat and longer vocal lines is vv good :)

		<ul>
			<li>god I love the panning back and forth</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>DAMN that start to new magic wand :OO

		<ul>
			<li>what an insane journey of a track; the story of him struggling with his partner is poignant and depraved, but it feels genuine and emotional :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>a boy is a gun is a classic too; the little vocal sample behind tyler&#39;s smooth verses and choruses ties this together amazingly imo ^

		<ul>
			<li>the conflict (and self-reference) is a huge perk to this cut, it&#39;s honestly, weirdly moving and significant ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>was not expecting ye on puppet, but the ties to the theme and purpose of this cut in the tracklist is great too- the beat and everything wrapped up beautifully here too :oo</li>
	<li>the huge difference between the insanely distorted synths behind tyler&#39;s rapping, and the honestly beautiful, normal instrumental- is incredible

		<ul>
			<li>didn&#39;t expect slowthai either but his presence is also a gift- OH MY GOD the laughing :OOO</li>
			<li>this cut is absolutely ridiculous and god I fucking love it...:oooo</li>
			<li>the deep breaths...</li>
			<li>letting go, or being okay with it...?</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the fact that all of the vocals on pt 1 of gone gone / thank you is tyler is rly damn impressive honestly- this first part is a bit of a good moment, of self-realization and a come down from the seemed unadulterated rage of the last track ^

		<ul>
			<li>mf ceelo green... my god dude :)</li>
			<li>and wow, the part where is full voice comes through is amazing (thank u jerrod carmichael btw) :O</li>
			<li>thank you is a really beautiful part of the track, and a clear sort of feeling to cap this whole thing off :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the rough production of i don&#39;t love you anymore is thematically genius- it might be a bit surface level, but with the strained chaos of the chorus and vocal sections as a whole, I think it adds a lot of genuine, creative sensationalism to the cut :)</li>
	<li>an al green sample, jack white on guitar, and a pharrell cameo? god damn dude, what the fuck

		<ul>
			<li>the careful, driving instrumental, along with tyler&#39;s close-to-normal voice tying this record up into a bow... this whole thing is just fantastically intoxicating :ooo</li>
			<li>oh my god â€” that comeback...</li>
			<li>speechless</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
