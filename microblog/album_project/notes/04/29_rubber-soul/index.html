<h1>mini notes for rubber soul</h1>

<ul>
	<li>it&#39;s a really simple song, but I love the instrumental of drive my car; it&#39;s layered and a intriguing for such a theme :)</li>
	<li>norwegian wood is genuinely my favorite beatles song ever; it&#39;s such an absolutely beautiful track with the sitar, and the layered instrumental in each ear compliments the style wonderfully :D

		<ul>
			<li>the lyrics are interesting as well, and lennon&#39;s vocals come off really smoothly ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I can think of you won&#39;t see me as just a basic sort of folk rock track for the beatles, but it&#39;s still somehow a standout moment for me; I&#39;m really liking this so far :)</li>
	<li>nowhere man is probably the weakest though lol

		<ul>
			<li>the lyrics are still interesting, but I&#39;m not as captivated or intrigued by the instrumental</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>think for yourself is just like you won&#39;t see me; it&#39;s not super complex, but the lyrics and the way the instrumental feels still makes it a lovely track ^^</li>
	<li>the way the word starts :o

		<ul>
			<li>not my favorite as it goes along, but not bad</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oooooh shit I know michelle :OOO

		<ul>
			<li>that track is so good with the mixing into french and the very supple bass(?) that goes along in the background and ending; absolutely wonderful track :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow, what goes on didn&#39;t start great for me but grew on me very quickly :)

		<ul>
			<li>the way it ends was really damn good too</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>girl is a pretty nice track, and the meaning is... right there, it&#39;s obvious</li>
	<li>i&#39;m looking through you I think is a more compelling continuous moment from girl; it&#39;s more masked and foggy in its interesting elements :)</li>
	<li>in my life is a beautiful little track (and the way it starts is lovely); one of my more favorite and calmer tracks so far :)</li>
	<li>I think wait and if I needed someone go hand in hand in the tracklist, and both are pretty interesting, great ways to keep the LP going</li>
	<li>and while I get the point of run for your life, I can&#39;t help but think it could&#39;ve been ended better... but I guess I&#39;m not the beatles (:</li>
</ul>
