<h1>mini notes for currents</h1>

<ul>
	<li>woah what, I already recognize the start of let it happen :O

		<ul>
			<li>while on its own it&#39;s a fantastic start, those skips and hops starting around the minute mark are an amazing way to hint the coming track shift :)</li>
			<li>it ends up meandering a bit, but it&#39;s a neutral feeling effect ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>nangs is just kinda there lol</li>
	<li>god damn the moment is another infectious start- it&#39;s hard to not like this LP when it&#39;s continuously interesting lol</li>
	<li>honestly not enough was surprising or interesting enough on yes i&#39;m changing to really grab me unfortunately :/</li>
	<li>eventually turned out to be pretty good though, those huge bass hits were the best part in my opinion</li>
	<li>there was a track in between eventually and the less i know the better?</li>
	<li>I don&#39;t need to convince you about anything about this next one (:</li>
	<li>honestly past life might be one of the more interesting tracks here, I love the it carries its sound and has such overtly weird and compelling elements</li>
	<li>disciples is a great little follow-up interlude too :)</li>
	<li>holy shit, the guitar and bass work on &#39;cause i&#39;m a man is absolutely lovely, jaw kinda dropped for a second there :O

		<ul>
			<li>oh right; the theme and rest of the song is good too, ye ye</li>
			<li>the chorus, in all seriousness, is so ethereal :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>reality in motion is a nice lil punchy jam too- the backend of this LP is not lacking at all :)</li>
	<li>ooooh fantastic start to love/paranoia; the bass throughout is such an earworm ^^

		<ul>
			<li>dude, that guitar :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god, new person, same old mistakes is such an amazing closing track; the wingspan across its runtime is genuinely shocking :OO

		<ul>
			<li>i&#39;m starting to understand even more why this is a cult classic...</li>
			<li>are you fucking kidding me with the ending? pardon the language if you feel like it but jesus christ... the lines I kept seeing about this record was &quot;perfecting music,&quot; and while I still think that&#39;s hyperbole... I see what they mean</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
