<h1>mini notes for the low end theory</h1>

<ul>
	<li>wow what a start to this album, that beat behind q-tip’s rhymes is absolutely infectious, and all the bars are poetically inclined with some great introspective elements :)

		<ul>
			<li>absolutely lovely start ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>they do call him dr. pepper :)

		<ul>
			<li>OOOH both phife’s verse and q-tip’s verse following right after are so smooth, and the subtle and offset cadence of them is so satisfying :D</li>
			<li>god buggin’ out is just an absolute treat from start to finish :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I love that out-tide line, so spry—and god this beat on rap promoter is an earworm :O

		<ul>
			<li>great little ending and transition to…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that beat on butter :O

		<ul>
			<li>I don’t want to be that guy, but this beat is smooth as— nvm</li>
			<li>oh okay phife dawg said it so I’m good—but holy shit that line where he goes through the women’s names and how he treated them… god damn that’s crisp as hell :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>verses from the abstract is a nice little downtempo track, more tired than the last but never sleepy or uninteresting; some of the bars here are the most introspective yet, like “The thing that men and women need to do is stick together / Progressions can’t be made if we’re separate forever”

		<ul>
			<li>that upright bass is such a fantastic choice for this track :)</li>
			<li>I also love all the references to rappers (artists) that q-tip respects, like big daddy kane, busta rhymes, etc.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god damn, show business is an absolute slam, that beat and quick sample under these high-profile and exciting rhymes is stunning :D

		<ul>
			<li>that lord jamar verse is a great little feature, and going right back into phife’s verse is lovely :))</li>
			<li>sadat x is really damn good too, but HOLY diamond d’s verse is fantastic over this beat :DD</li>
			<li>one of my favorite moments on the record for sure, this whole thing is an earworm ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I just have to say how much I love the song title “vibes and stuff” :)

		<ul>
			<li>it really fits the song though (ofc), all the verses straddle the line between playfully casual and still overtly serious in the provocative themes, like q-tip’s referencing of the little engine that could as a way to comment on kid’s gang culture ^</li>
			<li>a very casual way to bring about these themes, incredibly compelling track :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay, I kinda like the commentary and general attitude on the infamous date rape- it’s definitely much more interesting in terms of its status than that of other misogynistic tracks of the time ^

		<ul>
			<li>good on them I guess, it’s still an incredibly compelling track ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>GOD that beat on check the rhime :DD

		<ul>
			<li>all the call-and-response stuff is so satisfying and casual in how skilled it is; I love this so damn much :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while everything is fair might be the most okay track so far, the commentary and verses on life in the city (nyc) is interesting and definitively personal throughout the runtime ^</li>
	<li>great little transition to jazz (we’ve got) :)

		<ul>
			<li>green dolphin street is lovely for this cut ^</li>
			<li>that dancehall type interpolation at the start of phife’s verse is a great little moment for a callback- and this whole track is so subtly interesting and almost somber in its intonation :)</li>
			<li>I’m glad it has the runtime to stretch out and grow with these verses back and forth ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>skypager, somehow, while still having elements similar to all other tracks here, is still keeping things interesting over this 50 minute runtime :)

		<ul>
			<li>that funky beat behind it is a great way to separate the remaining tracks and give a little breath back to the listener (me)</li>
			<li>you’re welcome ;)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>all balls no cock?

		<ul>
			<li>that menage a trois set was incredible lol</li>
			<li>these constant questions and clear connections being made is a great almost interlude… not my favorite, but it’s a useful moment for the record no doubt :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>scenario is an absolute romp, that instrumental is amazing :)

		<ul>
			<li>I may be less than blown away by charlie brown’s verse, but GOD dinco d is incredible on this track :D</li>
			<li>busta rhymes is a classic as always with a gritty verse closing off this record (which I think is a nice moment, given how much tip was commenting on him earlier in the tracklist)</li>
		</ul></li>
