<h1>mini notes for sheer heart attack</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I absolutely mf love this start of this album; brighton rock is my favorite queen song of all time, it’s so wild and explosive and completely unique to my ears :DD

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a chaotic trip, everything from the guitars shredding on each side of you, mercury’s explosive falsetto singing, and those breakbeat drums… god damn this thing is special :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and then there’s a classic right after—I might not like listening to queen a lot of the time since it’s a very specific mood for me, but I’m never not happy when killer queen comes on :)

		<ul>
			<li>yea this song is absolutely lovely, I can’t say anything bad about it; great stuff so far ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I think I may only know one more song off of this LP though, so this will be interesting; tenement funster starts off interestingly, with a more slowed down instrumentation, and roger taylor on vocals instead of mercury… it’s a unique little ballad, and I do appreciate the placement of it in the tracklist (even if it’s still odd)</li>
	<li>ooh, wild transition into flick of the wrist, that was crazy :O

		<ul>
			<li>wow, the imagery and meaning behind the track is really well-done, and those deep background vocals that compliment the start of mercury’s vocals go over really well ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay okay these transitions are getting out of hand

		<ul>
			<li>if that was a three-part melody, lily of the valley was a nice little ending to it; I don’t think it’s anything mind-blowing, but it’s a good conclusion to that segment of the LP</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>huh, now I’m here is a bit of an explosive comeback from track five; I’ll always love those layered vocals complimenting mercury on that bridge/chorus/whatever, but I’m just not really shocked by the rest of the song I guess(?)</li>
	<li>oh my god that vocal panning on the start of in the lap of the gods was amazing :D

		<ul>
			<li>wow I was not expecting this grand sort of moment on the record; it feels borderline ethereal, especially in the context of the rest of the record</li>
			<li>great stuff :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>what a mf transition into stone cold crazy tho :OO

		<ul>
			<li>the songs might not fit exactly thematically, but the drum switch is perfect :)</li>
			<li>this song is absolutely crazy, this is the second best track imo :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow, was not expecting either dear friends or misfire… both feel like weird little moments for the record, just like a bit of wild experimenting

		<ul>
			<li>freddie’s singing on both is really good though, I must say; they may still be weird detours, but they’re good detours :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>what the hell is bring back that leroy brown (??) :O

		<ul>
			<li>it’s so weird, it’s really damn confusing in this tracklist…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>she makes me (stormtrooper in stilettos) was a confusing moment for me at first too, but it delved into some interesting moments that warranted its placement in this tracklist

		<ul>
			<li>it’s definitely much more interesting and better than the last track, at the very least :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and the revisit (reprise) of in the lap of the gods is really a good moment; it may be entirely dependent on that former track, but those vocal harmonies, explosive drums… it’s a really nice ending :)</li>
</ul>
