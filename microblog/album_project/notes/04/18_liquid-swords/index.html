<h1>mini notes for liquid swords</h1>

<ul>
	<li>honestly, not the intro track I was expecting at all- minimal beat with a kind of swagger about gza’s own skill; the samurai theme and skits from old movies is a nice thematic setter, but I’m just not blown away yet tbh</li>
	<li>wow okay, I’m into it now; the bars delivered by gza, masta killa, and deck—and just the general thematic verse cohesions—are rly damn impressive on duel of the iron mic :O</li>
	<li>that beat and the huge span of the verses is so rly good on living in the world today as well; it’s a bit less huge in its introductory message as the previous, but all the verses feel more expansive and extraordinary :)</li>
	<li>ooh my god that deep, scratchy beat on gold is the best I’ve heard here so far from rza’s production- absolutely incredible stuff :D

		<ul>
			<li>god damn that second verse :o</li>
			<li>this is my favorite track so far, this cut is insane; I can’t compliment that beat enough either :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>cold worlds is another nice cut, but it’s not as compelling as previous cuts; it’s another interesting inner-city life type memoir, but with less of a huge impact as others imo</li>
	<li>the slower, deeper start of labels is a good beginning, but it has a similar effect on me as cold worlds; I’m not complaining about hearing more, I’m just spoiled by modern examples of similar and influenced hip-hop LPs</li>
	<li>ooh the start to 4th chamber has me back in it in a little way- ghost’s contribution is amazing, with such a smooth inflection over his increasingly compelling and sincerely imaginative bars :D

		<ul>
			<li>killah priest has a good piece too, but I like how aggressive rza sounds as he comes in- his voice naturally feels a bit buttery/smooth, but the clear sharpness of his articulation is great here :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>shadowboxin’ is a great little moment on the record, with both gza and method feeling so comfortable over this beat- the stories they form are interesting, and makes this feel vital to the album even if it’s not my own personal favorite ^</li>
	<li>woah, interesting start to hell’s wind staff / killah hills 10304; both the drug deal going on for the first third of the track, and the high-pitched synth leads in the background of this story gza tells

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a bit of an interesting moment, and it leads into one of the better tracks on the album too imo :)</li>
			<li>damnn, the second half of that massive verse was specifically incredible :O</li>
			<li>really happy he let the beat ride too, I appreciate that little respite from the long tales of his surroundings and related life ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>investigative reports is a bit of a slowdown in terms of my total interest though; the u-god contributions aren’t incredibly interesting, and raekwon is just pretty good

		<ul>
			<li>but to be fair, both gza and ghost have rly good verses; it’s a good track regardless, but my points stand ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>swordsman is honestly kinda similar to that for me; it’s not incredible in the total runtime, but the story told and the articulation is still compelling ^</li>
	<li>i gotcha back is a nice little (true) ending; it’s a bit of everything honestly, with that nice sample instrumental and occasional piano coming through in a significantly interesting way under some of gza’s best rhyming and lines in general on the record

		<ul>
			<li>it’s incredible compelling, and it fades out beautifully for the album to end on :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“But it&#39;s an everlasting game, and it never cease to exist / Only the players change, so”

		<ul>
			<li>the fact that those are the final spoken lines is almost harrowing- absolutely incredible ending with both that and the shogun assassin scene capping off a stellar work :OO</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
