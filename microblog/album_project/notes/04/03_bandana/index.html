<h1>mini notes for bandana</h1>

<ul>
	<li>what an incredible intro lol (:</li>
	<li>freestyle shit is a very casual actual first track, not sure how I feel about this style atm; I like bits and pieces</li>
	<li>half manne half cocaine has an insane beat behind, I love the lo-fi aesthetic to it all :D

		<ul>
			<li>I’m gonna have to warm up again to gibbs’s voice because it’s not as smooth as expected, but everything feels so calculated together- even if it’s not completely rigid</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ohhhh that sample on crime pays :O

		<ul>
			<li>another track where I love the general feeling of the whole track, but freddie’s voice comes off without a hitch for me this time :)</li>
			<li>all the bars feel like butter ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that whole change-up into massage seats was insane- just like the little instrumental features of the track itself :O

		<ul>
			<li>a lot of this so far has left my brain spinning, it’s so out there and detailed it’s hard to keep up ^^^</li>
			<li>the gary line and the derailed paragraph that comes from it is great :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oooh the noriega days line and that whole sequence was great on palmolive— and OH killer mike :D

		<ul>
			<li>pusha t’s verse addition is perfect in this track too, this is my favorite over crime pays atm :)</li>
			<li>and the reagan to obama line was really good- I’m not going to look into the deep introspective detail of the obama part, but the progression laid out, bookended by killer mike’s chorus is great ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow… the progression taken throughout fake name, and the thematic and beat change matching together not long after the start of the second verse… it’s all jarring, and a fantastic way to bring up and subvert themes of death around freddie’s past :O

		<ul>
			<li>that outro tho lol</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>jesus what a hard song to re-pack into this LP after fake names; every single line here is packed with intense history and meaning, especially potent coming from freddie ^^</li>
	<li>situations feels like a good continuation of theme, with a simple little beat and a slick delivery of all of the bars here; I like that the more barebones feel of this track matches well with the fact that this is all about his history and past/present lifestyle

		<ul>
			<li>damn, the billie jean back into the beat line is amazing :)</li>
			<li>starting to appreciate his obama lines a lot more, the change in feel of each one of the dense references is great ^</li>
			<li>hahahaha this outro, I love this over the organ &amp; bass :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh real G’s move in silence like giannis :D

		<ul>
			<li>god the sparse features here are great, I hope the black thought &amp; yasiin bey combo is as fantastic as it sounds; but compliments to paak here, my god :O</li>
			<li>oh yea and giannis is a good track too, but whatever (:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the bit of introspection and reality check in terms of his own feelings is a great shift (especially after paak’s piece on the last track) here on practice :)

		<ul>
			<li>the pokémon line is the best here haha</li>
			<li>god the beat here is incredible too :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I’m not as greatly impressed by cataracts, but all the little details, from the beat, bars, inflection of his voice… it still comes together well ^</li>
	<li>I feel like gat damn might be similar, but the meaning behind it, losing friends and dealing with more of his past- it’s hard not to be sympathetic over such a personal topic and great production :)</li>
	<li>yea— jesus christ education was an absolute journey through some of the best, possibly underrated minds in this

		<ul>
			<li>every single part of the track feels perfect; each verse from each artist feels like such a personal, introspective journey through the same similar experiences three completely different people experienced, and I adore it all :OO</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>soul right is a great way to cap this all off, I have only these words left</li>
</ul>
