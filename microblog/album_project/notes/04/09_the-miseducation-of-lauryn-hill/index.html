<h1>mini notes for the miseducation of lauryn hill</h1>

<ul>
	<li>a nice little thematic start :)</li>
	<li>huh honestly that&#39;s not what I was expecting with lost ones; the beat is relatively simplistic, but the lyrics come through despite any initial personal aversion</li>
	<li>god the layered vocals on ex-factor are lovely; I may have similar feelings to the last track, but the more mellow direction compliments this cut rly well</li>
	<li>surprised by the santana feature; it fits really well, even if I don’t really know how tho :O

		<ul>
			<li>the track still unfortunately doesn’t blow me away, but the attitude and genuine personable articulation is certainly not lacking ^^^</li>
			<li>I really like these interludes; the insightful points from the women in the class feels like something that would just normally happen, and just adds to the thematic points of this record :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit the next track was doo wop (that thing); god damn this track is incredible :D

		<ul>
			<li>the punchy, minimal beat with the deep piano in the background is fantastic, and her voice is absolutely incredible :OO</li>
			<li>definitely my favorite track so far, even if I liked ex-factor a lot too :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I didn’t have a lot of strong feelings towards or about superstar; it was definitely good as usual, just nothing standout even for this record imo</li>
	<li>okay a lot of the bars and rhymes on final hour were really damn good; in terms of lyrical ability they’re some of the best I’ve seen on this album so far :)</li>
	<li>ooooh when it hurts so bad has such a nice groove to the instrumental (with the harp and other instrumental choices), but I loved that starting moment when lauryn’s voice went so low and the timbre of her voice shuddered a bit; genuinely incredible, this is the second best track :D</li>
	<li>okay I think a lot of my thoughts thinking this isn’t as good as I thought it was going to be pretty much went away with i used to love him; it’s a perspective that was absent at the time that it released, and on top of being hugely influential, it’s still incredibly appealing and interesting to listen through in full :)

		<ul>
			<li>it helps that the song is catchy as all hell ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>forgive them father was a bit of a lull unfortunately for me; the beats are never bad, the lines are never not introspective and useful, but it just didn’t shine to me</li>
	<li>every ghetto, every city was a great little romp though- I love the instrumental with the huge bass line, again with some lovely bars from lauryn :)</li>
	<li>god the crossover with d’angelo is something I never thought I would love this much; them trading these statements back and forth is a lovely energy… and I’m just now realizing both of them are quite similar in the way they went about their careers and individual styles ^^^</li>
	<li>everything is everything is a profound little subsection of this record, and fits wonderfully after the last cut imo :)</li>
	<li>and I can’t not love the piano ballad that is the title track at the closing three cuts; it’s so beautiful with her voice flowing over top of the harmony :D</li>
	<li>can’t take my eyes off you is a nice little sentimental cut, but… while I know these are hidden tracks, I can’t help but feel these would fit into the main album better than after the title, real ending track</li>
	<li>especially tell him honestly; the themes of this track makes sense to be placed after (and both are still great tracks), but I wish that true ending was how it all closed up ^^</li>
</ul>
