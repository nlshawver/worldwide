<h1>mini notes for stoney</h1>

<ul>
	<li>okay honestly, that weirdly-styled set of guitar riffs are honestly not bad, I’m just not really in with the lyrics as much; that beat isn’t bad too, so for a debut album’s first track, not bad ^^</li>
	<li>big lie is one of those inoffensive cuts; that hook is honestly not bad at all, I’m just not blown away at all</li>
	<li>I get no feeling from deja vu though, it’s like scrolling through instagram, feeling cathartic wasting your time there- the justin bieber is really what seals the deal for me :c</li>
	<li>okay I have to be real though, no option is a fantastic little banger in the midst of this snore fest… that beat and bass descent is just such an ear-candy moment :)

		<ul>
			<li>not an incredibly interesting track, but everything just comes together right for me; it’s playful and entertaining with its production value and especially post’s floaty vocals</li>
			<li>ROLEX WITH THE DIAMONDS</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>good jeff verse?

		<ul>
			<li>lol anyways, cold has a really interesting, icy beat at first… but everything else about the track is just meh; post’s lyrics aren’t interesting, and the snaps/claps on the beat are just incredibly boring :(</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>middle school track incoming; I won’t mince words, but this track, while iconic, just isn’t super compelling anymore? it’s just something that’d be in the background while you have a much more interesting conversation with your friends about better music

		<ul>
			<li>the bass is the most interesting part of this track, and while the come-up story of post is not something I’ll ever bash… this is not the track that represents his best work</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>fall apart is kind of a sad boy track, but in an inoffensive way—it’s perfectly okay in that lane, and I won’t criticize it for that</li>
	<li>patient, on the other hand… I just do not like this thing at all, it’s just a boring auto-crooner cut in the midst of an okay string of tracks :c</li>
	<li>go flex is a more interesting cut, with that sung hook from post going over pretty nicely; good stuff :)</li>
	<li>feel just feels (haha) meaningless and a bit boring, not really contributing much of anything, and reveling in some weird sexual motifs

		<ul>
			<li>like yea, it’s fine, but this is another soul-crushing instagram/tiktok track :(</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>too young is another sleepy cut, there’s not really anything to say about it, it’s just begging to be skipped</li>
	<li>god damn, the more I listen to congratulations the more I hate it; it’s the other super iconic track off of this album, and for a bit of a good reason, but I just can’t stand it anymore

		<ul>
			<li>it comes together in a rickety, basic, and incoherent way at times :/</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>big surprise, a track with pharrell behind it isn’t all that bad lol

		<ul>
			<li>up there is another pretty good moment honestly, it’s respectable in its theme and the self-actualizing way about it :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yours truly austin post isn’t a bad track, and it ends pretty well; nothing could’ve been better I guess</li>
</ul>
