<h1>mini notes for quality</h1>

<ul>
	<li>thank you dave :)</li>
	<li>those guitar stings on rush are a really surprising touch- I’m not super compelled yet by this project, but at least these lines are interesting and impressively intoned ^

		<ul>
			<li>damn that section before xzibit’s part is really satisfying; unfortunately some of these parts just feel a bit unsatisfying and grimy in a less-than-ideal way… I will anxiously wait to be proven wrong</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooooh shit get by is huge; that kanye production is so damn good with the piano, the constant hits/claps… it’s all incredible :D

		<ul>
			<li>god damn that hook :OO</li>
			<li>everything about this track is so damn compelling with how it carries itself; it’s so confidently positive in its sound :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>shock body is a rly good continuation; the same sort of confident, almost mafioso-type styles are still here, still great :))</li>
	<li>gun music kind of extends into those same sort of confident aesthetics, but that jamaican sort of styling is both kind of great and weird at the same time ^

		<ul>
			<li>it’s B.J. wineglass to u ;)</li>
			<li>that was a really good track ngl :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh bilal on this one? damn :o

		<ul>
			<li>honestly, I really like the bars that kweli lays down, but sometimes the instrumental gets in the way- not audio-wise, but in terms of the general aesthetic</li>
			<li>it might not be that serious, but it’s just what I noticed earlier on in the track’s runtime</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>joy is honestly a really distinct, compellingly emotive moment on the record- mos def (yasiin bey) being here for the hook all about kweli’s thoughts and feelings about his daughter being born is honestly a fantastic moment

		<ul>
			<li>I love this track :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow… talk to you is a moment I wasn’t expecting at all, but came off absolutely perfectly

		<ul>
			<li>it’s such a caring, introspective, and lovely cut with bilal back for some vocal ear candy :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I might be more focused on how guerrilla monsoon rap doesn’t really fit the previous track, but the fact that there was a huge span of time from the outro onward nullifies that for me

		<ul>
			<li>this track is absolutely incredible- with ye, black thought, and pharoahe monch all bringing absolutely incredible contributions to an already great cut with kweli :D</li>
			<li>thank u kanye lol</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn, dj quik with that little sting :o

		<ul>
			<li>okay honestly not a bad track, but there’s time where it just feels meh- and that dj quik verse is honestly mid as hell :/</li>
			<li>it’s a weed track though, so no worries lol</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit… it might not be over the best beat on the record, but jesus christ the meaning and sociopolitical introspection of the proud is absolutely tantalizing from start to finish in how it all plays out for real people not dedicated to the system that institutes so much oppression</li>
	<li>beautiful hook from res, and the verses that kweli spits here are equally as smooth and introspective in nature :O</li>
	<li>the dilla beats are getting to me, lovely stuff ^^</li>
	<li>stand to the side is another pretty good cut coming up on this record’s ending, with some wonderful singing from vinia mojica :)

		<ul>
			<li>the hook might not be the best, but still not bad ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oooh I love the revisiting of these confident, bragging verses on good to you; the al green sample and ye production yet again is a great combination with kweli :))</li>
	<li>great little journey for the final track; kendra ross is a good addition, and kweli’s verses are a smooth, almost effortlessly compelling focal point to this track

		<ul>
			<li>good stuff, amazing ending :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
