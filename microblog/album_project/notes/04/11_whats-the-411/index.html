<h1>mini notes for what&#39;s the 411?</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I was a bit confused and bored w the opener, but I do like the thematic choice of it- and then the beat of reminisce came in and just exploded with such an appealing, unique style :D

		<ul>
			<li>genuinely, I absolutely love that track ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>YOOOO frank sampled this cut :O

		<ul>
			<li>I&#39;m loving this record a lot rn; real love has a punchier beat but all the same niceties and confident swagger that reminisce has :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>you remind me is a great follow-up... I&#39;m really searching for faults rn, because this is literally everything I could&#39;ve asked for so far :O

		<ul>
			<li>that lil wind instrument at the end is a great little addition :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>haha busta rhymes&#39;s part is so playful and ridiculous; nice bit of interlude ^</li>
	<li>god her voice is even more ethereal (or rather, sort of angelic) on sweet thing; still the same amazing aesthetic :)</li>
	<li>love no limit was the first time I realized a lot of the album is maybe a bit overly similar or consistent- still a good track, and i don&#39;t want to do anything is another fantastic cut right after :)</li>
	<li>okay yea, slow down was pretty good, but I&#39;m starting to get that aching feeling from hearing the same, similar sort of beat and lyrics for fifty minutes- again, it&#39;s not a dislike at all, it&#39;s just getting a bit worn now</li>
	<li>my love is a bit better, but it&#39;s still the same feeling unfortunately :/</li>
	<li>changes i&#39;ve been going through is a bit better tho- the beat is punchy, and everything feels exactly in the right place ^^</li>
	<li>and the final title track is the closest thing to a return to how I felt before- it has a bit more punch to it, but in the end it just sort of sizzles out for me...</li>
</ul>
