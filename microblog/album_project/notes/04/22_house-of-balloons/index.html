<h1>mini notes for house of balloons</h1>

<ul>
	<li>huh… while I wasn’t incredibly excited by the introduction, that chorus on high for this is actually really good, with that scratchy, warbled bass and the vocal ad-libs from mr abel :)</li>
	<li>I am not really feeling what you need though, it’s just kinda there; there’s not a ton that’s super compelling to me honestly ^</li>
	<li>okay while I’m still swinging in between understanding this record and just not favoring its articulation… house of balloons / glass table girls is pretty damn good, I have to be honest

		<ul>
			<li>but it’s not anything incredible to me, it’s still just kinda sittin there</li>
			<li>BUT I’M A NICE DUDE WITH SOME NICE DREAMS :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>like, yes I completely get the point of this record, being a tale of how sex, drugs, etc. are great in the moment, but the bastardization of human feelings can destroy someone after the fact… but like… I just don’t like the morning

		<ul>
			<li>I don’t super-like the sound of the song with how obtuse that beat feels to me, and while his vocals are good as usual imo, it just doesn’t mesh with this beat incredibly well</li>
			<li>the chorus beat is a bit better, especially that drop, but it doesn’t give it any more personality</li>
			<li>the lyrics can be really grating too, and not in the best way at all to me</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>i genuinely don’t know why this isn’t connecting with me much, it’s just a bit of an okay, downtempo set of party hits I guess

		<ul>
			<li>the message doesn’t outweigh the quality of the music to my ears I guess &gt;&lt;</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and in a way… are these songs not telling the same story over and over again? that may be the point, but it is a bit prone to getting stale, especially on the party &amp; the after party

		<ul>
			<li>that little chopped/screwed moment around two minutes in, and I thought well of it, but the beat just went back to the same alright way about it….</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay, I took a little break—and coming down is honestly not bad; I like that beat and inflection combo on the chorus, and it feels like an actual nice pace for the song (that bass is incredible too)

		<ul>
			<li>maybe I hated a little too much, but this was a pretty good cut :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>nvm loft music put me right back in the mood of not wanting to listen to this much more</li>
	<li>and… nvm again? the knowing is surprisingly good—it’s not incredible, with almost painfully boring kick drum, but that chorus is actually pretty special

		<ul>
			<li>an incredibly flawed record ending on somewhat of a good note; good stuff I guess :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
