<h1>mini notes for good kid, m.A.A.d city</h1>

<ul>
	<li>honestly, I knew exactly what I wanted to give this before I even posted it; I may not have listened all the way through to pimp a butterfly (coming up soon), but I have heard this all the way through, many, many times</li>
	<li>if I make it that far, I’ll make a formal review of this instead of just one of these… but for now, today’s a relaxing day where I get to listen to a fantastic album :)</li>
</ul>
