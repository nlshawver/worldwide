<h1>mini notes for 4:44</h1>

<ul>
	<li>wow what an incredible start with this punchy instrumental and almost business casual energy to jay’s delivery; great lead into this LP :D

		<ul>
			<li>no I.D. is a treasure for this record ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and the next track I think is already a classic in my mind; the overt meaning and shockingly upfront confrontation of jay’s statements throughout this are incredible :O

		<ul>
			<li>yea the interlude before the second verse is pretty callous, but it’s honestly needed; the drum beat that comes in—slapping behind pure advice bars—accentuates all of his points really well and wraps this up really, really well ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>smile’s first verse is so calming with this slightly abrasive beat over ethereal vocal samples :)

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a simple track, and it’s not as standout as I think other tracks, but it’s a medium-high point imo ^^^</li>
			<li>the journey of his third verse is amazing too; it’s huge without feeling overbearing, especially with his mom’s outro cutting him off (:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god that bridge is so smooth for caught their eyes :O

		<ul>
			<li>oooooh the frank ocean chorus hits so well in between the verses :D</li>
			<li>the density and lyrical meaning of the bars he delivers feels like such a late-career ramp up for jay, I’m so glad he had this moment in his discography</li>
			<li>compliments to the beat chef btw ^^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit and the next track is the title track… this is my favorite song on the album by far

		<ul>
			<li>every single moment, from the huge vocal sample, the beat-breaks, jay’s lines and almost conversational tone throughout… it’s a masterful showing of a deeply personal side of himself; the execution is incredible :OO</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the kind of playfulness that comes after on family feud is great; it starts off and keeps noting themes of family ties of course, but the resolution seems reached already in terms of the place jay wants to be in his life at this moment

		<ul>
			<li>especially given that interlude about the tallest midget lmao :D</li>
			<li>I also love the “what’s better than one billionaire?… two” where you just know he’s smiling behind the mic when he said that :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my god the bass on bam; it’s shaking my headphones :O

		<ul>
			<li>the “birth of a nation, nat turner style” line is the standout here lol</li>
			<li>I don’t know how I feel as much about this track- I think it fits well after family feud, but it doesn’t nearly reach the peaks of many other tracks here imo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>moonlight has a bit more of the casual swagger I like; it’s not my favorite, but it’s still a great hit :)

		<ul>
			<li>the meaning of all these tracks (but special shoutout to this one) are really, really good</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the transition into marcy baby is amazing too; it’s another personal cut that compliments this whole LP really nicely

		<ul>
			<li>the start of that second verse is insane lol :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my god, legacy is a seriously great ending- the start and general message of how jay feels seems concretely sincere in how he goes about it, and the laid-back, sauntering style of the last few tracks contributes greatly into how this caps off a great album from a legend</li>
</ul>
