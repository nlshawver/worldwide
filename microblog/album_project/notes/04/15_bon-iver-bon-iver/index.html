<h1>mini notes for bon iver, bon iver</h1>

<ul>
	<li>don&#39;t know how much I&#39;ll like this style... but this first track is at least surprisingly interesting and compelling in how it&#39;s articulating itself :o

		<ul>
			<li>that was an incredible transition, kinda shocked at that and how well it went :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>with those crunchy synth bass lines under the verses, minnesota, wi is a great little number to come right after ^</li>
	<li>don&#39;t know entirely how I feel about this LP yet, but holocene is a really beautiful kind of track; lovely vocal motifs and I rly like vernon&#39;s voice at times like these :)</li>
	<li>and while I like the general change in style of towers, it’s not a huge standout in terms of replayability or anything for me</li>
	<li>michicant has a really pretty start to it though, the vocals are on point ^

		<ul>
			<li>the small, quick change of scenery in the instrumental is pretty cool too ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh wow, the deep voice kinda got to me on hinnom, tx :o

		<ul>
			<li>was very brief and to the point, but in a very nice way; it felt perfectly intoned for this project :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn that piano on wash. is beautiful :O

		<ul>
			<li>that was incredible; might be my favorite individual cut on the record, even if I think that first three track run was really damn good too ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>calgary was a rly nice follow-up though, good stuff- and with lisbon, oh acting as a nice lil interlude, this is carrying itself well to be a great conclusion :)</li>
	<li>yea beth/rest is another beautiful track that caps off this album nicely; it’s not my favorite with some of the vocal timbre and almost organ-like instrumental… but I’m definitely not complaining, cause it was just really nice overall :))</li>
</ul>
