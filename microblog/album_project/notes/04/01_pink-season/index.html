<p>To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Pink Guy. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of traditional politics most of the jokes will go over a typical listener’s head. There&#39;s also Joji’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these songs, to realise that they&#39;re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Pink Guy truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn&#39;t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Frank’s existential catchphrase “Bitch look good for a four year old,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev&#39;s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I&#39;m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as George Miller’s genius wit unfolds itself through their headphones. What fools… how I pity them. 😂</p>

<p>And yes, by the way, i DO have a Pink Guy tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It&#39;s for the ladies&#39; eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they&#39;re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎</p>
