<h1>mini notes for floral shoppe</h1>

<ul>
	<li>oh my lord I&#39;m in for a treat :D</li>
	<li>those tripped vocals and off kilter drums are a great combination on this opening track :)

		<ul>
			<li>it&#39;s incessantly weird but perfectly aesthetically pleasing ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and we get right into THE vaporwave track :DD

		<ul>
			<li>literally every mf part of this song is perfect to me- it&#39;s creeping along, always searching and growing like vines into my ears... and that vocal sample is harrowingly somber and regretfully beautiful</li>
			<li>I am astounded at every in-depth listen :OOO</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>it took me a little bit to get into the third track on the album, but afterwards it just kind of grew into something simple and lovely :)</li>
	<li>the vocal sample on the fourth track is kind of interesting too; I don&#39;t know how I feel about it fully yet, but I thought it was a great addition to the album as a whole ^^</li>
	<li>I have a little inkling of doubt about that fifth track; it&#39;s still good, and it adds to the album, but I don&#39;t know...it was just kind of boring(?)</li>
	<li>ohhhh shit :D

		<ul>
			<li>I get it now; that last track was like a bit of pressure on the brain, but this next one is just absolutely incredible with how it grows and releases that tension :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that extended calm nature of that seventh track is beautiful too; I just downright love this thing so far :)</li>
	<li>god, and the simple elegance of that aviation interlude is justâ€¦ so satisfying :D</li>
	<li>damn both that and the next little cut are lovely little respites :)</li>
	<li>oh fuck, but we&#39;re right back into it on that tenth track :OO

		<ul>
			<li>god damn, this captures a lot of that same half-explosive, tensile energy of 420 ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>woah wtf- that ending cut just dies instantly... I don&#39;t even know what to think with that one, cause the sample was eerily calming in an odd way

		<ul>
			<li>what a mf album tho :O</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
