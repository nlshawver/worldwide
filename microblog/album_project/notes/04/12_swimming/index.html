<h1>mini notes for swimming</h1>

<ul>
	<li>honestly, just kind of a somber, sort of sleepy, yet appealing start; not bad for an album fantano gave a three lol</li>
	<li>hurt feelings is just a bit of a nice, slightly punchier resolution into the themes of this record; it’s a pretty good track I guess :)</li>
	<li>the thundercat bass has blessed the third track :D

		<ul>
			<li>while I initially thought the lyrics were just a bit tugging at artificial heartstrings, it turned around pretty quickly- and the chorus / late verses are lovely too (even if I’m still not the biggest fan of mac’s voice all the time :)</li>
			<li>that mainly instrumental bridge is real nice too ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>perfecto just kinda left a bit of an average chill track taste in my mouth, until that nice little ending; it curved it around in an interesting way, I like that ^^</li>
	<li>self care has jid, blood orange, and erykah badu? woah :O (just learned they’re not really ~on~ the track, but still cool)

		<ul>
			<li>that beat is insane under mac’s voice; it fits better than I would’ve ever thought ngl :)</li>
			<li>the chorus is the best part so far ngl ^</li>
			<li>absolutely lovely beat flip into the second part :)</li>
			<li>the theme and meaning of this track is generally just freezing- it kinda just leaves you wondering, pondering the mental conflicts and pressures of what mac was going through; it’s haunting and hopeful ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>above all else, it earns that runtime, and the transition into wings was as good as it could’ve possibly been :)

		<ul>
			<li>and honestly, while wings was mostly just kinda there for most of its own runtime, that final minute and a half was actually rly good imo ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>both small worlds and conversation pt. 1 are surprisingly good to me; I don’t thinks its standout necessarily for this record, but it’s still great :)</li>
	<li>dunno is another track that takes me a bit to warm up to, but I really love its aesthetic and the way it flows :))</li>
	<li>wow... I don&#39;t know whether its the ethereal voice on the chorus or the careful confidence of the verses that makes jet fuel a genuine standout cut for me, but I don&#39;t rly care :D

		<ul>
			<li>the lyrics definitely help :)</li>
			<li>the ending is wonderful too, such a trip ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and then 2009 and the final track are a stellar end- I can&#39;t say the ending is as standout as I&#39;d have hoped, but it&#39;s still lovely- great ending to a surprisingly good album :)</li>
</ul>
