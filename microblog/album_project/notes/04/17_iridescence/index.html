<h1>mini notes for iridescence</h1>

<ul>
	<li>jesus, same immediate energy on here as saturation III; that crunchy beat is absolutely infectious :O

		<ul>
			<li>all the verses through this thing are amazing, but kevin abstract and merlyn wood’s especially are incredible :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the transition and thematic shift into thug life is great too, it feels so natural and kinda beautiful with that piano in the backdrop ^</li>
	<li>and right back into it with berlin :O

		<ul>
			<li>holy SHIT- that bearface chorus with that hugely industrial instrumental is a face-melted with how insane it gets :D</li>
			<li>the joba verse at the end feels a bit off, but the calm aesthetic of his verse offsets how insanely crunchy this song is</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>something about him is a nice interlude moment, a bit of a respite in a way- and while I like where the cash at in terms of its callbacks to cash on saturation, it’s just kind of alright to me (certainly good tho, just not my favorite)</li>
	<li>the way it goes straight into the strings of weight is really damn good though :O

		<ul>
			<li>abstract’s verse is a great match with that somber sort of energy, and the scratches after are such a huge moment :o</li>
			<li>joba &amp; dom’s verses too :D</li>
			<li>just a lovely cut in the midst of this wild journey; I love the self-reflection and the depths of emotion ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow… district is such a huge statement, and while it’s playful at times in the effects and intonations, the main piece as a whole just feels absolutely shuddering in its stature :O</li>
	<li>loophole is a lovely interlude too :)</li>
	<li>damn, tape is similar to district for me- I’m blown away by the lyrics and the way each member comes across and shows themselves on the track, even if the beat isn’t my absolute favorite ^

		<ul>
			<li>yea tape is definitely one of my favorites on the record, the strings to end it off and just the way it transcribes its thematic message is incredible :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy fuck… blown away by joba on j’ouvert :OOOO

		<ul>
			<li>tape into this is absolutely insane, I don’t know how this is even possible; merlyn on the third verse(?) is incredible too, and bearface’s contributions are lovely too :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that transition :o</li>
	<li>oh my god, I thought honey started off well with abstract &amp; wood again, but that ending minute with the huge synth leads; absolutely incredible :D</li>
	<li>god damn dom :OOOOOO

		<ul>
			<li>I’m not a huge fan of the way vivid fits into this tracklist I think, but jesus christ if his verse isn’t incredible alongside matt on the start :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while I don’t think I’m blown away or anything by san marcos, the somber and reflective tone that it splits away into is a great moment for the album I think; the verses have a great amount of meaning and significance to them too :o

		<ul>
			<li>the guitar on the start just set me off I think, not a huge fan for that</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow, both abstract and bearface on tonya are lovingly crafted little moments- their emotive nature about past events and especially ameer on bear’s verse elevates this track a lot ^

		<ul>
			<li>oh my god that ending is beautiful :OO</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>joba and kevin on fabric are both beautiful- the verse from abstract and half-bridge that joba delivers are lovely

		<ul>
			<li>I am… conflicted about that ending though</li>
			<li>it feels so disjointed yet calculated, I just don’t know how it feels as the ending to such an LP ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
