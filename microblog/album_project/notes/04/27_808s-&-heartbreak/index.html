<h1>mini notes for 808s &amp; heartbreak</h1>

<ul>
	<li>honestly, I don’t know what to expect going into this; its the ye project that I know the least about in terms of its specific tracks (even if I know the huge departure in style)</li>
	<li>that back and forth synth note is iconic already though, I can already recognize this and I genuinely really like this start :)

		<ul>
			<li>the t-pain influence is honestly something that has—over the course of my growth in music and being more adventurous—become something I genuinely like a lot of times; that overt autotune can add a lot of worthwhile and interesting flair that mangles (in a good way) the human voice into something intriguing, something that can match the tone of the record really well ^</li>
			<li>those crisp vocal harmonies are beautiful too; when the instrumental yields for a bit, it’s a touching moment for such a low-key introduction to this LP :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow, was not expecting the stylistic points to stay so interesting into the second cut too; I knew beforehand that welcome to heartbreak is regarded as one of the more compelling tracks, but I couldn’t have suspected how much I would’ve liked it :)

		<ul>
			<li>the ending is interesting if not strained in those vocal notes, but the strings are amazing :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>absolute mf classic with heartless :D

		<ul>
			<li>that deep bass and machined-down wind instruments that pop in at the main verse are an absolutely incredible, and the way ye leaps back into the chorus is just… so satisfying :))</li>
			<li>this three track run at the start is absolutely magnificent, I just hope it doesn’t follow in graduation’s footsteps at the cliff’s face</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that simple piano melody behind the deep intonation and crunchy compression of ye’s voice is a great continuation into amazing; more and more is coming forth from this LP in a fantastically soulful kind of way :)

		<ul>
			<li>that jeezy feature is not bad either, the inflection and contrast (while still containing the core message of the track and LP) is a rly good way to flow into the tracklist</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>huh… I really like the huge, shuddering bass on love lockdown, but I can’t connect as much with the instrumental on the chorus; it feels way more disconnected from the rest of the aesthetic, and is almost obnoxious? that may be the point, but at least on first listen I’m wary

		<ul>
			<li>the lyrics on the verses are great though in all honesty ^</li>
			<li>shit okay that ending with the expanded drum break instrumental, with those synths coming though… damn I underestimated that choice; insanely captivating ending :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>WOAH that verging-on-disco aesthetic of paranoid is incessantly interesting and it serves as an almost hopeful, exciting cut :D

		<ul>
			<li>cudi being sprinkled into this record is an absolutely legendary choice, visionary level inclusion :o</li>
			<li>this has been the most surprising and compelling cut for me so far, it’s such a weird mix of electropop, disco, personal rhymes from ye… it’s a landmark in the middle of the runtime :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while robocop certainly isn’t the most groundbreaking track in this LP, its weird meshing of sounds flow together surprisingly well; it’s almost orchestral, and the sugar-coated aesthetic of distrust is (while almost typical to me now) is still interesting :)

		<ul>
			<li>that ending is genuinely kinda funny, while still being a bit terse and rife with uncomfortable emotions from ye ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>street lights is another uniquely intoned, almost dazzling cut; the two minimal yet wavey verses are distressing, with that warbled, high synth and deep piano complimenting it really well

		<ul>
			<li>it’s almost like an intermission/interlude, that leads right into</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>bad news, which is almost squirming with that same distressed effect on ye’s voice, and the alien sounding synth notes

		<ul>
			<li>the instrumental turn is something that I think fits the cut (and LP as a whole) really well, allowing it to stretch out and grow in my mind without ever feeling forced ^</li>
			<li>god those deep bass kicks are amazing :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while I think see you in my nightmares starts off really well (with weezy fitting surprisingly well with his own autotuned vocals), the confident change that grows more with ye’s verses I think is what sours this a bit

		<ul>
			<li>wayne’s BLAAaaoow sort of inflection (lol) is a bit interesting at first, but gets old pretty quickly unfortunately</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and I wasn’t really sold on coldest winter at first, but with that second verse, and ye proclaiming “Her love is all that I can see” …it’s an emotionally touching start that leads into some deeply troubling depths that this track breathes life into…:ooo</li>
	<li>wow…</li>
	<li>god that huge contrast between the screaming crowd, and ye’s apologies, intrusive thoughts, and metaphorical tales are absolutely gutting… it’s a track that spurs you on in a dark sort of way, and it’s the closest I got to feeling absolutely torn up mentally on this LP

		<ul>
			<li>it’s just heart-wrenching with ye’s second verse being so powerful and verging on guttural… and the way he himself feels on the verge of a breakdown on that third verse, never feeling growth from what he has dealt with</li>
			<li>jesus christ, this album…</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
