<h1>mini notes for oxnard</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I was a bit chilled by the start; not much happens, but it seems like a good opener now that headlow is on

		<ul>
			<li>which, by the way, is a great, minimal soul cut that I think hits a pretty good nerve in my brain (especially with the bridge and chorus :)</li>
			<li>okay that mf outro is completely ridiculous, wth</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god that outro sucks because the next track is so damn good; that incredibly funky bass line and general harmony is amazing with both paak’s verses and kendrick’s feature :))</li>
	<li>oooh woah… who r u? has such a minimal, punchy beat and general energy to it that—while not truly outstanding imo—is still shockingly catchy :)</li>
	<li>honestly I don’t know what to think of 6 summers; part of me loves pieces of the verses and how they flow in and amongst themselves, but I don’t think the chorus itself is all that great… but that switch-up and the final minute are pretty damn good ^</li>
	<li>the swagger in the flow and general interlude-type stylings of saviers road is a nice little detour… good stuff :)</li>
	<li>ooh that switch in the middle of smile / petty was a great way to go about this sort of style; I can’t comment much on smile, but the bass line and intricacies of petty are really damn catchy ^

		<ul>
			<li>paak’s voice always sounds almost sounds adventurous and yet at the same time completely casual; great stuff :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow, those synth lines on mansa musa, over the most villainous I think I’ve ever heard paak… that dre feature goes over amazingly, and this whole track is insane :OO</li>
	<li>damn same with this brother’s keeper with pusha t :O

		<ul>
			<li>this whole thing sounds so damn huge, I love the way push and paak trade throughout the track, and the sort of contrast each of them have against each other’s voices</li>
			<li>AHHHH THE JASON DERULO LINE</li>
			<li>that’s an amazing comedown too, the guitar line that comes in a more serious way into this track is a great choice :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>of course snoop is on here too lol; I don’t think I’m as blown away by the feature and some of the cut as a whole, but the last two minutes are lovely with the way paak stretches out and relaxes over this lovely beat :)</li>
	<li>honestly… not a bad j cole feature; I might be a bit hard on him, but for the second last track on the (normal version of the) LP, I like it a lot more than I would’ve expected ^

		<ul>
			<li>it justifies its runtime too, with some great mellow sections and nice guitar work in the background :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>what an emotive way to cap off this record… I might not have loved q-tip’s verse as much, but both sections, dedicated to mac and phife, are just so lovingly crafted and hugely introspective

		<ul>
			<li>I can’t not love the dedication, love, and energy that made it onto that cut -&lt;&gt;-</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
