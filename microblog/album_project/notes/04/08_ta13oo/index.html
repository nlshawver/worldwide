<h1>mini notes for ta13oo</h1>

<ul>
	<li>that&#39;s a nice, almost soulful start to that album :)

		<ul>
			<li>I don&#39;t have much to comment on the opening track, it&#39;s just rly nice</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow and I love the continued theme on black balloons; the chorus feels like such a high point after delving through some pretty melodic verses :O</li>
	<li>I love the almost casual flows over the punchy bass beat of cash maniac too; nyyjerya&#39;s choruses are also amazing :D

		<ul>
			<li>that chopped outro is amazing too :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while I thought the second verse especially was great with that insane change-up in terms of intensity... I don&#39;t know, sumo didn&#39;t do a lot for me :/</li>
	<li>ooh okay... I had similar feelings at first about super saiyan superman- but that second chorus convinced me, right before the track exploded and disintegrated with that huge synth bass (i think lol)</li>
	<li>holy shit that first verse of switch it up :OO

		<ul>
			<li>the play between the beats on those bars is incredibly catchy, I love this whole thing :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while I&#39;m not crazy about mad i got it, the end of the second verse is amazing with those bars about slick like oil money (paraphrasing, but you know)

		<ul>
			<li>that third verse is also really damn good ^</li>
			<li>god these track endings are incredible</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>it was at this point I realized I for some reason don&#39;t have the full version of the album on itunes; I&#39;m missing sirens and vengeance for some reason

		<ul>
			<li>give me a sec :c</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy— okay I’m really glad I took the time to find the full version, because sirens is one of my favorite tracks here; jesus christ both denzel’s first verse and jid’s verse are incredible, poking at such great themes especially for when this came out

		<ul>
			<li>HOLY SHIT the third verse of the track is the best thing I’ve heard on this record so far- I first that verse over denzel’s cover of bulls on parade, but with the context of this record it feels genuinely perfect :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while it’s not my own personal favorite, clout cobain is by far one of curry’s most influential tracks he’s ever made; it’s definitely iconic and a great hit on this LP :)

		<ul>
			<li>the raichu bar (:</li>
			<li>the beat is also damn good ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>again, another track that wasn’t a standout to me at first in the blackest balloon turned into a surprisingly introspective, insanely appealing cut on the start of act 3 of this record :O</li>
	<li>jesus christ, the huge amount of energy on percs is absolutely insane; that beat behind these incredibly detailed verses from denzel are amazing, and all the commentary strewn throughout is the clear highlight for me :OO</li>
	<li>damn… I thought the start and midsection of the record was great on its own, but the bangers that keep showing up throughout the entirety of this third and final section is incredible; vengeance is an absolutely brutal cut that starts to cap off the insane nature of the ‘dark’ act of this LP in a fantastic way :O

		<ul>
			<li>that sample and interpolation at the end is beautiful too :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>all of these final cuts are all jaw-dropping, my god…

		<ul>
			<li>black metal terrorist is such a chaotic, hugely moving beat to slam this record shut; I don’t know how to accurately describe all of the minute details and huge themes across this LP, but it definitely shut up a lot of my initial criticisms quickly</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
