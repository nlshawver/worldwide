<h1>mini notes for vaudeville villain</h1>

<ul>
	<li>god DAMN that introlude and the title track are absolutely incredible; that beat is something to marvel at, and I love this character aesthetic too :D</li>
	<li>shit, that firestarter line and kmd reference is insane :O

		<ul>
			<li>lickupon in general isn’t my favorite, but like above there’s a good amount there to like :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“Either M-Y-O-B or B-Y-O-stretcher” damnn :oo

		<ul>
			<li>the drop is about the same for me, just a nice cut with staggering rhymes ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my god, that storytelling on lactose and lecithin is really damn good; the first few bars paint a vivid picture, and the sound effects and energy of the beat matches perfectly :))</li>
	<li>a dead mouse is another stunningly interesting track, every single instrumental moment is intriguing- that harp, the sound effects, the deep bass and ride cymbal… it’s amazing :D

		<ul>
			<li>please fix the flux capacitor</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>hahaha willie b on the start is hilarious :)

		<ul>
			<li>thank u mr sambuca</li>
			<li>oh my mf god, that rodan (dr. moreau) verse is INSANE :OO</li>
			<li>second verse is pretty good too lol</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>woah raedawn is such a weird trip, with that startling, chaotic instrumental riding under almost— GREY POUPON :DDD</li>
	<li>and wow, can I watch? is a great back and forth; apani b fly is absolutely stellar on the track, I loved that :)</li>
	<li>damnn, and right into that HUGE beat of saliva :O

		<ul>
			<li>this shit is incredible, it’s such an earworm :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>a modern day mugging was similar to lickupon &amp; the drop, just a good cut in the middle of this fantastic set</li>
	<li>part two of mic night was a bit of chaos :o</li>
	<li>never dead is another great trade-off back and forth, but honestly this was the one moment that didn’t stick out or wow me as much— it was just a bit of the same (even if that’s not bad at all)</li>
	<li>popsnot is that slight change of pace I needed; it spreads out and mellows out even in the track’s runtime :))

		<ul>
			<li>the beat gets to shift and settle, and when doom (*viktor) comes in, it feels effortless and full of casual confidence</li>
			<li>that sax at the last two minutes is lovely too :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>mr. clean’s beat is clean—humour

		<ul>
			<li>okay in actuality though, that is a really good little track; it serves its purpose perfectly, giving a nice little two minute trip :)</li>
			<li>the rhymes towards the end are incredible too ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>FROZEN TO DEATH BY THESE RHYMES ;)))))

		<ul>
			<li>okay g.m.c. is one of the better tracks at the end; it’s not a clear standout, but the way it carries itself is all that matters here ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>what an atmospheric, incredible ending :OO

		<ul>
			<li>the bars dumile spits after that three minute intermission are even more powerful given that aesthetic derived from that soundscape</li>
			<li>the playfulness at times also gets to me- this shit feels effortless :DD</li>
			<li>I absolutely love this album, and I’m so glad I added this man’s insane discography :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
