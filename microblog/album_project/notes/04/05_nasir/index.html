<h1>mini notes for nasir</h1>

<ul>
	<li>wow, this was not what I was expecting at all- I guess it makes sense given this is part of kanye’s five album run in 2018 under his production, but I love the sample and beat behind surprisingly great bars from nas imo :)</li>
	<li>while I love the richard pryor sample at the beginning to set this off well, and the slick rick piece is great on its own, it’s just a bit grating and muddled when nas and ye have their own verses; not bad, but not as appealing as its preceding track ^</li>
	<li>white label brought more of that same sort of style for me- the production sustains its amazing value for the runtime of this LP, but there wasn’t much that stuck out to me in all honesty

		<ul>
			<li>the slick rick bars and the whole second verse is really good though imo; the samples are consistently useful and supplement this all nicely :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while I’ve seen negativity shown for the next two tracks, so far bonjour is honestly a pretty good cut; the line “laissez le bon temps rouler” at the cut of the second verse is amazing, and it feels like a bit of a pick-up for the record’s pacing ^^^</li>
	<li>although— personally I don’t like everything much…

		<ul>
			<li>don’t get me wrong, nas’s verses contain some really introspective lines that may top a lot of other things seen on this LP (that murciélago line and continuing tale was amazing), but this really doesn’t earn its long runtime :/</li>
			<li>it genuinely just feels like a ye song (which I realize is a bit dumb given that this was part of the wyoming sessions), and it sort of kneecaps the whole experience :(</li>
			<li>the beat is also probably the most uninspired of the LP so far ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the only track I had heard off of this record before this review was adam and eve… and while I really like that song in a vacuum, it fits a little less snugly than I would otherwise hope

		<ul>
			<li>all the bars flow really damn well though, like the “spendin&#39; fifty large at the bellagio / spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know” line; it’s an amazing way to peak this track’s theme :)</li>
			<li>a great track no matter what, but it doesn’t hold up as much I expected it too, I guess is what I’m trying to say</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>this beat on simple things is kinda bland too; this record lost a lot of its luster very quickly for me :/

		<ul>
			<li>I think that final verse and line is great… but it’s such a disappointing, meaningless ending in terms of any greater context; it feels chopped up in a weird way, not really showing what could’ve been achieved ^</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
