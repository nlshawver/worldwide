<h1>mini notes for black on both sides</h1>

<ul>
	<li>nice little spoken word intro for a while on fear not of man; good stuff, and a great transition into hip hop :)</li>
	<li>great sample and instrumental on hip hop, and that final minute was probably my favorite even if I just think it’s an average track</li>
	<li>I love yasiin bey’s voice and the timbre of it though, the start of love is a good treat with that

		<ul>
			<li>a lot of the rhymes and intricacies of love are really nice; that stuttering bridge/chorus is really nice too :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and a classic with the aptly titled ms. fat booty

		<ul>
			<li>that sample is lovely too, hard not to be with aretha franklin :)</li>
			<li>I might not be entirely blown away by this track rn, but it’s still one of bey’s better tracks—I’m just not feeling it atm</li>
			<li>it it honestly beautiful in its articulation tho honestly ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that quick cut to speed law is great too, damn :o

		<ul>
			<li>one of the better cuts too imo, I love that beat behind some more specific and intricate rhymes :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh busta rhymes on this? not bad :O

		<ul>
			<li>I love that back and forth :D</li>
			<li>DON CHEADLE IN THE BUICK REGAL?</li>
			<li>really chaotic but likable ending, good stuff :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly though, this is a great series of tracks, love to here has been really damn good; my only concern is how thin this album might stretch itself given that 70 minute runtime</li>
	<li>huh, not the beat I was expecting to hear behind got with that deep, crunchy synth riff :o

		<ul>
			<li>honestly pretty good track, but I can’t shake the feeling that idk how I’ll feel in another forty minutes (even if I know mathematics is incredible)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I like the light singing and simple jazz-ish instrumentation behind the start of umi says, it splits things up quite nicely :)

		<ul>
			<li>wow okay, I really respect this sincere introspection and more somber and yet hopeful aesthetic of this; genuinely my favorite track so far :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that whole-track double entendre for new world water is great; the dedication to that thematic point is amazing in itself :O

		<ul>
			<li>the little xylophone sample riff is great to, adds to the atmosphere (and was a great re-introduction to the more heavy tracks after umi says)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I definitely appreciate the merit and meaning behind rock n roll (since I agree with it, black musicians were the true originators of rock n roll, punk, etc.), but god I just did not mesh with this track on first listen, especially that end

		<ul>
			<li>I like the cincy name drop, but it feels like such a weird, borderline meaningless moment on the record— converting to fast punk rock for a thirty second segment just felt weird</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yea it felt weird going straight back to pretty much a black star track right after (even if I like it a lot)

		<ul>
			<li>that sample behind talib and yasiin goes really well; can’t tell if it’s a deep piano or just plain bass, but it goes over great :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow, and I was not expecting climb’s beautiful interlude and difference in the tracklist but I absolutely love it :D

		<ul>
			<li>it’s again like umi says ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and I didn’t get to talk about it as much, but I adore the interpolation and continued growth and inventive cuts that define brooklyn; its features that on their own are absolutely amazing, but morph really damn well into habitat (continuing the same aesthetic) :D</li>
	<li>every single minute detail in the instrumental of habitat is absolutely lovely, this whole experience turned around for me in a surprising way after rock n roll :))</li>
	<li>damn, and the meaning, feature of q-tip, and general stature of… track fifteen… is absolutely lovely, and one of those additional perspectives that keeps this LP interesting (and my mind attuned properly to that which other people experience)</li>
	<li>LET’S GOOOO mathematics is an absolute treat at the (quickly approaching) end of this record; I’m incredibly glad for umi says because that track and what followed shifted my mediocre thoughts on this album to greatly positive appreciation :)

		<ul>
			<li>this track is a master-class of sampling, and hugely impressive meaning within mind-bending rhymes :DD</li>
			<li>thank u mr premier c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings / But you push too hard, even numbers got limits / Why did one straw break the camel&#39;s back? / Here&#39;s the secret / The million other straws underneath it / It&#39;s all mathematics

		<ul>
			<li>GOD FUCKING DAMN DUDE, I love this guy with a burning passion sometimes</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>a very tasteful, and incredibly lovely instrumental to close this off is a wonderful touch :)</li>
	<li>I don’t think I can give this a full score simply because of my mediocre feelings towards the start of this LP, but I think that may turn around a bit once I get formal ratings after this stretch of daily marks ;)</li>
</ul>
