<h1>mini notes for ready to die</h1>

<ul>
	<li>jesus what a chaotic intro, from curtis mayfield to crime to big plans :O</li>
	<li>things done changed is a triumphant introduction to the sound of biggie, and my lord — even if it&#39;s a previously unknown track to me, the qualities of a master are all there :))</li>
	<li>god, the boom bap beat behind biggie&#39;s inflection and proclamations on gimme the loot is my personal peak so far; it&#39;s so tough and huge in its stature :D</li>
	<li>while I&#39;m not as in love with machine gun funk, the beat is genuinely infectious as all hell :)</li>
	<li>warning almost feels like an interlude in terms of its feel and general styling; it&#39;s a nice mini shift in terms of a lot of its thematic choices ^</li>
	<li>the title track is an absolute masterpiece though- from the introspective bars all throughout the verses... it&#39;s a great peak to the first piece of this long, story-driven LP :O</li>
	<li>part of me is a bit confused going from such interpersonal themes on the title track to the dick wagging of one more chance

		<ul>
			<li>and holy shit fuck me is exactly what it sounds like- it&#39;s an album sex scene</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay anyways... pleasantly surprised by the placement of method man on this ^</li>
	<li>ignoring all those weird feelings from before... jesus christ juicy is such an incredible song :D

		<ul>
			<li>every bar is personable, and it all just meshes into itself so well</li>
			<li>the super nintendo sega genesis line is a bit dumb, but god damn i love it :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and wow- I wasn&#39;t sold on everyday struggle at first, but that beat is classic, and the last verse has some of my favorite lines in the whole album :)</li>
	<li>...damn— I thought me and my bitch was going to be a braggadocio&#39;s sort of thing, but god damn that last line was powerful :OO</li>
	<li>holy shit and then it&#39;s right back to the infectious romp of big poppa- genuinely might be his best song ever, it&#39;s such a fantastic story laid on top of such an amazing isley brothers sample :DD</li>
	<li>OOOOOH respect is by far the best deep cut here; this three track run is the best section of the whole record I think ^^^</li>
	<li>friend of mine doesn&#39;t have nearly the swagger of a lot of other tracks here, but it&#39;s not a bad track at all, no worries ^</li>
	<li>while I think I have similar feelings about unbelievable, the almost playful nature of the track in general is pretty infectious; it&#39;s a pretty good cut coming up on the end of this LP</li>
	<li>—</li>
	<li>I don&#39;t know what I expected from the final track, but sitting in my car, late at night, hearing all that come through... it&#39;s a haunting experience; there are no proper words that explain the feelings felt from person to person...</li>
	<li>what a legendary album</li>
</ul>
