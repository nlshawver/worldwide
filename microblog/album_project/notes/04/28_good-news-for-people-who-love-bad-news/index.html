<h1>mini notes for good news for people who love bad news</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I wasn&#39;t initially confident of the style that came through on the first real cut, the world at large, but it turned into a nice little ballad by the end; not as iconic or interesting as the other record I reviewed from them (the lonesome crowded west), but not bad at all</li>
	<li>and then float on is a classic, I absolutely love this track :D

		<ul>
			<li>that transition is insanely well done too, that was incredible :OO</li>
			<li>it is kinda weird hearing isaac brock appreciate these little moments in life; from what I gather this is a rare moment in their discography :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ocean breathes salty was a relatively nice follow-up, but it isn’t nearly as memorable as the previous two cuts imo 6</li>
	<li>bury me with it has a bit more to it, and I like the way it divulges a bit at around the midway point into chaos… but I honestly just can’t connect a ton with the vocals rn—I will hold my breath for later in the LP though of course</li>
	<li>okay dance hall is just… idek, this is just not good to me

		<ul>
			<li>I’m gonna try and ignore that</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>alright alright, I love the casual honesty and story-telling of bukowski though, it’s way more interesting that the past two(ish) tracks, and I love the instrumental style too :)

		<ul>
			<li>the ending is interesting too, with the deeper inflection of brock’s voice coming through really well ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>dude… okay this album is incredibly flawed, the two tracks that bookend bukowski just make no sense in terms of, you know, album cohesion :/

		<ul>
			<li>I fear the ability for this album to salvage those low points</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh okay, the view is really damn good; I might like the general aesthetic of it more than bukowski, but both are wonderful moments (comparatively)

		<ul>
			<li>and wth the start of that second verse is amazing :D</li>
			<li>everything that follows it is as well is just as intriguing, and a wonderful alt rock abode :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>satin in a coffin is a nice, rockist continuation of the aesthetic prior, and I like the way it carries itself ^^

		<ul>
			<li>my only fear is that it (and the following tracks) cannot make up for the chaos of this record</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and wow, I am genuinely loving the introspective notes and calm, subtle instrumentation on blame it on the tetons… it feels vulnerable and it’s a valuable experience for the record to have :O</li>
	<li>black cadillacs is the most destructive sounding track here, and unlike previously aggressive cuts, this cut has merit in its sound and cohesion in that underlying themes its getting across; this backend is really damn great so far :)</li>
	<li>one chance explodes again with valuable, intriguing passages of alt rock bliss, and I love the back and forth that seems to go on with the energy level

		<ul>
			<li>that little break that goes into brock’s distorted vocals is ear candy :))</li>
			<li>that and the slower, downtempo ending was a great way to lead into the final cut ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the flaming lips bit at the start was a great little cameo—and I absolutely love the commentary that brock proclaims in a straightforward manner

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a creeping, weird track that has a lot of merit behind what brock’s saying; the instrumental behind him is absolutely lovely too, the staggering drums and weird, meshing harmonies are a great instrumental comparison that allows the message of this LP to end on a purposefully full-of-real-life experience</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
