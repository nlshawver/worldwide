<h1>mini notes for modern vampires of the city</h1>

<ul>
	<li>this instrumental and the general aesthetic of this so far is really nice; big fan :)

		<ul>
			<li>honestly really beautiful, interesting start… I think I have almost negatively boring thoughts about vampire weekend’s first two albums at this point, but I hope this is different</li>
			<li>atmospheric noises :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>great transition into unbelievers, still keeping up this great intonation to this record that I really like :)

		<ul>
			<li>that chorus is satisfying as hell, lovely stuff; holy shit that bass :D</li>
			<li>even better than the intro, this is truly great so far ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>step is a great, typical song for vampire weekend; it pretty much sums up everything that sounds exactly like VW

		<ul>
			<li>really somber, great ending to that track… but I feel like that feeling is cut short really quickly by the next track in a kinda harsh way :/</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn that voice effect on diane young is not that appealing or good at all… which sucks cause I think the rest of the instrumental is actually pretty good</li>
	<li>I like don’t lie a good amount tho, it feels wonderfully chipper and still unique at the same time; the deeper voice inflection later on is a fantastic touch :))</li>
	<li>wow… hanna hunt is a great little number, it feels both personable and specifically important ^</li>
	<li>everlasting arms is another beautiful cut; it&#39;s like something to completely fit a comfortable rainy day, and the way it fits that mold is perfect :D</li>
	<li>damn and the playful nature of finger back is incredibly infectious... maybe the earlier midsection of this record was a bit lackluster, but this is lovely :)</li>
	<li>haha the chaos of worship you is amazing- perfect summer sort of cut, and the actual words he&#39;s speeding through fit that vibe well too ^^

		<ul>
			<li>that teched out synth break goes over rly damn well, esp with that drum beat that explodes in after that bass note descent :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ya hey is another perfectly VW track; every element in the vocalizations and instrumental are carefully cut in that same consistent cloth of articulation :)</li>
	<li>that creepy atmosphere and blown out drum section are such a dark turn into hudson; it&#39;s surprisingly interesting in its operation and feels like a crazy experience ^

		<ul>
			<li>this back end of the record is incredible, genuinely- to think I almost wrote off this record feels ridiculous at this point, similar to currents yesterday</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>it&#39;s a simple and very brief cut at the end... but I love how young lion fits- the piano felt so different and distinct from what hudson put you into, and the lyrics from ezra come through in a very meaningful way :)</li>
</ul>
