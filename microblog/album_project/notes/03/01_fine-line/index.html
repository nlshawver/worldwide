<h1>mini notes for fine line</h1>

<ul>
	<li>these first three tracks are an incredible start, and form the album into almost an instant pop hit</li>
	<li>I do like the energy and aesthetic shown off in the mid-section, but starting with Lights Up it feels like a lot of the the themes are very surface-level unfortunately; it’s still a pleasant, relieving sort of sound</li>
	<li>sunflower, vol. 6 is an incredible, cute kind of return to that pop sound, and it’s absolutely lovely… maybe we rly should listen to dancehall :)</li>
	<li>sort of falls apart at the end honestly- a lot of the instrumentals and vocals are shown off well, but they don’t compliment the ending style as well as I’d have hoped</li>
	<li>okay some elements are still rly good, I eat some of my words; the peaks of this LP are near pop perfection, and honestly the title track is a really great cap to the record :)</li>
</ul>
