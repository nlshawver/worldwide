<h1>mini notes for led zeppelin III</h1>

<ul>
	<li>we all know the start of this album lol

		<ul>
			<li>one of their best songs obviously, and a great start to this record :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>friends was not what I was expecting to follow up immigrant song at all; I feel like it’s a pretty good cut, but this record so far is following a lot more blues rock conventions

		<ul>
			<li>whether they mesh with me well is the question I guess</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>celebration day starts really damn well, which is a good sign ^^

		<ul>
			<li>that bass line is incredible, genuinely- I’m just not super blown away by the track as a whole</li>
			<li>it’s great in its own sound though, which I can’t knock it for</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>since I’ve been loving you is honestly another good cut, and some of the verse lines are shockingly good

		<ul>
			<li>I’m still just kinda standoffish about it tho, being completely honest</li>
			<li>jesus okay, that’s the best blues song I’ve heard from zeppelin- it turned around and grew in a really nice way, that was really damn good</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my mf god that bass on out on the tiles is SO good :D

		<ul>
			<li>this is the second best song on this album lol</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yea gallows pole is maybe my least favorite song here, unfortunately :c

		<ul>
			<li>it just derailed a lot of the well-intoned blues tracks here, and it’s honestly just kinda disappointing to my ears</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>tangerine isn’t a whole lot better, but it’s more of a nothing cut right after to me- there’s not much to feel about it</li>
	<li>that’s the way is honestly a bit of a return to their actual interesting way of incorporating blues into their music, but it doesn’t carry its runtime as well as out on the tiles or even since I’ve been loving you at all</li>
	<li>bron-y-aur stomp is not bad either- it starts out less good than I would’ve hoped, but it also grew into something more than the sum of its parts I think

		<ul>
			<li>the ending third especially was pretty good :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yea but hats off to (roy) harper just felt like tangerine—it wasn’t something that was outright needed, and ending on bron-y-aur would’ve sufficed :/</li>
</ul>
