<h1>mini notes for led zeppelin II</h1>

<ul>
	<li>what an absolutely heavy classic to start off this record… I don’t think this hits the conscious ping in my brain that communication breakdown does, but I think this cut is the closest equivalent on this LP :D</li>
	<li>what is and what should never be is a compelling cut after the opening track, and while I don’t think it’s incredible in their discography, the small instrumentation at times (like that gong two thirds through) has a great attention to detail :)</li>
	<li>I feel like there’s not much to say about the lemon song and thank you, they just feel like perfect inclusionary cuts in the mix of this record

		<ul>
			<li>that’s a serious problem with reviewing records so old… I can’t tell whether I just don’t like the sound in general, or it feels just pretty good, or if the bias of having such a swath of newer music influences greatly what I think of old records</li>
			<li>I feel like both are kinda true</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>at least I know heartbreaker is an absolute banger :D</li>
	<li>ohhh living loving maid is this song :O</li>
	<li>jesus christ this span of tracks is so insanely iconographic- ramble on and moby dick back to back is just amazing :D

		<ul>
			<li>the fact that it&#39;s just one huge drum fill &amp; solo makes it so much better, I legitimately laughed out loud when the rest of the instruments came in on that crash :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I feel like the ending track starts out as a sleeper, but morphs really nicely into a great crescendo ^^</li>
</ul>
