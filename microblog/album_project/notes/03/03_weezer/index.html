<h1>mini notes for weezer (green)</h1>

<ul>
	<li>this album is very short :O</li>
	<li>honestly the first track—and to an extent the second cut—are pretty good pop rock tracks, but it does have a very short shelf life; I think it might be a good thing that this record is essentially just ten snippets of power pop</li>
	<li>Hash Pipe and Island in the Sun—while very clearly not Weezer’s best cuts ever—will forever be great back-to-back; they each have a bit of tied nostalgia, notably in how connected they feel to the time they come from</li>
	<li>the rest of it is a bit hit or miss, but each track has a bit of interesting elements and cohesion to make it at least compelling for its runtime :)</li>
</ul>
