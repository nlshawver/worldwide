<h1>mini notes for evil empire</h1>

<ul>
	<li>jesus christ what an absolutely stellar start to this LP... bulls on parade is without a doubt an s-tier classic that literally never gets old :D</li>
	<li>vietnow felt like a bit of a middling yet smashing cut, but being layered between bulls and revolver is a great combination- because revolver is amazing :)</li>
	<li>oh my god and somehow snakecharmer leaps a bound over top of its predecessor; that was incredible :O</li>
	<li>I don&#39;t think I appreciated nearly as much the aspects of tire me, but the strains and general intonation of de la rocha&#39;s voice is always great ^^

		<ul>
			<li>oh and it&#39;s relatively similar for down rodeo, just this time with the main chorus and bridge; the instrumentation is great as usual :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>jesus and without a face is a great follow-up, I think the constant guitar somehow ties this together chaotically; it&#39;s a rly good thematic choice for such a cut

		<ul>
			<li>also sorry idrk what happened, but I listened to the following tracks off the book; I thought they were all good of course, but if any part of this record deserves a re-listen from me it’s them</li>
			<li>I think I got a little phased out, and didn’t truly listen deeply to what was happening</li>
			<li>my ipod died</li>
		</ul></li>
