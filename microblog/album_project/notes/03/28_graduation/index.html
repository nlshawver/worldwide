<h1>mini notes for graduation</h1>

<ul>
	<li>god damn the start of this record is absolutely lovely with good morning- I love it :)</li>
	<li>that steely dan sample for champion is built so well :D

		<ul>
			<li>I think this track feels a bit more dated than a lot of tcd and late registration, but it’s still really great :)</li>
			<li>yea in a way this gets a little stale quickly, but again… that sample :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yea we all know stronger, this is a classic :DD

		<ul>
			<li>the amount of people this reached and caused them to discover daft punk cannot be understated :)</li>
			<li>I love this track to this day, it’s probably the song that aged the best on this record ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I have to be honest… these first four tracks are absolutely insane (and even though I haven’t gotten to it yet, I know it’s gonna be the first five)

		<ul>
			<li>I wonder is such a great cut too, the implemented synths go over really well with such a huge, powerful beat :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yup, it’s definitely five haha :D

		<ul>
			<li>god t-pain is so underrated in terms of how good his vocals really sound anywhere- and this synth lead over the MJ sample is SO good :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>unfortunately can’t tell me nothing I think is the start of a serious landslide in terms of this record… like the track is still good, but it’s already a bit of a step back from that absolutely stellar five track run

		<ul>
			<li>yea that sample gets old much faster than champion’s does, and I think it’s implemented a lot less well</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yup, this really is barry bonds

		<ul>
			<li>that konnichiwa bitches line is the best part of this track lmao, thank u gza :)</li>
			<li>like I don’t think this is the worst ye song at all, since honestly that chorus with the huge bass and organ-esque chords is really damn nice… okay but I just got to it and that lil wayne feature is actually not good :(</li>
			<li>in a way the emotions between wanting to like this and hate this makes me just feel awful, which might be exactly what makes this not good lol</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay but drunk and hot girls might unequivocally be his worst, there’s not as punchy a sample to make up for this

		<ul>
			<li>the lines he pretty much just says all feel just bored, uninteresting, and something I don’t really want to touch anymore</li>
			<li>the synths have worn out their welcome with their implementations here, so I don’t know how this recovers</li>
			<li>god that last verse is so mf bad, oh my god</li>
			<li>I honestly just feel bad for yasiin on this ;(</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I guess this is one way to turn it around, flashing lights is the closest to that intro run as we’re gonna get I think- the verses aren’t as well formed as they were there, and the verse synths are a bit much, but it’s still retro in a nice way, and infinitely better than its preceding cut ^

		<ul>
			<li>I am starting to see the dated nature of these vocal line ‘samples’ though I think, they’re just a bit surface-level at times I guess</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>dj premier is the best part of everything I am honestly, I love that chopped and screwed sort of aesthetic… it’s an actual good contrast to the rest of this record, and a great sound :)

		<ul>
			<li>the ye verses honestly aren’t bad either, this may be the best track since good life imo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the glory is very obviously the closest similar track to that of late registration, but it only holds up to late registration’s midpoints I think- it’s a good track, but that might be it (which simultaneously makes this incredible for the second half of this LP)

		<ul>
			<li>wait okay this is actually really good, I like this :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that chris martin feature is incredible weird, but it’s not bad- which I think is the best way it could’ve worked lol</li>
	<li>I don’t think I’m blown away by the two ending tracks, but they’re not bad… I think it just sort of fades out, and doesn’t have as huge a feel as his two previous records unfortunately

		<ul>
			<li>big brother is just kinda there for me :/</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
