<h1>mini notes for 2</h1>

<ul>
	<li>wow that’s a great introduction to this album; the warped and twisted guitar lines with that level of personality is amazing

		<ul>
			<li>and on top of that, the meaning behind that song is both somehow funny and saddening- the double meaning of each chorus after each verse is great :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>dreaming is really good too, with the two guitar lines flipping back in your ears having such a great effect :D</li>
	<li>god that classic guitar sound… this whole track is just oozing with a great sort of persona (and the meaning behind the first verse is hilarious)</li>
	<li>annie felt just like a nice interlude, but ode to viceroy feels like a seminal classic for mac :)

		<ul>
			<li>I might not like those chorus vocals as much as I used to, but it’s still a great track ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while it wasn’t my favorite, I love the shattering guitar solo on robson girl… but unfortunately that’s about it- the lyrics just don’t mesh as much with me as the rest of the tracklist here</li>
	<li>the stars keep on calling my name is a great cut here; all the music is chilled and soft, but this track just feels especially like a bit of a relaxing break :)</li>
	<li>my kind of woman is a classic, but seriously every time I here it I just cringe- I’ve heard it so so much that it’s just lost most of its charm on me

		<ul>
			<li>I can still recognize that this is really good though, especially the end to the chorus :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow boe zaah is a great instrumental cut here, it serves a similar to purpose to the stars… but in a more foundational, significant sort of way :)</li>
	<li>sherrill just felt like a pretty good continuation, but still together feels so much more significant and such a worthwhile conclusion to this LP :)</li>
</ul>
