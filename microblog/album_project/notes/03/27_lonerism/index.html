<h1>mini notes for lonerism</h1>

<ul>
	<li>jesus what an intro :O

		<ul>
			<li>that bass under those warbling synths is insane, I love such an out-there kind of introduction :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>especially right before endors toi, which has the same great kind of synth use :D

		<ul>
			<li>that guitar piece at the end… oh my god :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>HOLY… okay I wasn’t super blown away by apocalypse dreams that much at first, since it sounded like a progression of the same sound— but that quick fade out and explosion back in… :D

		<ul>
			<li>that shit was INSANE, I am truly boofed; probably the best song here so far (even though it’s only the third track lol)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my god, every little part of mind mischief is just ear candy, from the panning from ear to ear, the little guitar solos, the huge synth leads that coast perfectly over everything— somehow this album keeps getting better and better :O</li>
	<li>music to walk home by feels almost like a tour of the motions of this album tho, it’s not as high impact to me as the other tracks (even if it’s still functionally and thematically perfect for this record)

		<ul>
			<li>that guitar outro is amazing too :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>why won’t they talk to me? feels like honestly the first track that felt just kinda there… nothing bad to say about it, but just nothing in general I guess</li>
	<li>feels like we only go backwards was always a track that I thought was just alright, but it does have a lot more meaning to it in the context of this record (and it’s still really damn great) :D</li>
	<li>keep on lying felt like a bit of a nice trip; it’s not anything crazy, but the fact that from halfway onward it just keeps building up this soundscape is a really, really nice fit for this LP :)

		<ul>
			<li>gotta be honest though, that laughing feels really insane at times and not in the best sort of way :o</li>
			<li>still cool tho ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my GOD elephant’s bass line is so infectious :D

		<ul>
			<li>AHHHHH jesus christ this is magnificent, I love every second of this :)))</li>
			<li>bank robbing music</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>i guess she just won’t believe u :(</li>
	<li>nothing that has happened(…) is another track here that just keeps growing in its overall aesthetic and place in the tracklist, like it’s fighting to keep your attention, even if it’s effortlessly winning at it

		<ul>
			<li>codeword language for the fact that I really like this track (oh and also this record has such great use of that panning back and forth, I love that :)</li>
			<li>jesus christ the way this track grows is immaculate</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>this may be the shortest feeling hour long album I’ve listened to in a while</li>
	<li>I guess in a way sun’s coming up is the perfect track to end on with how far it reaches past the idea of a conventional style—&nbsp;it just keeps exploring, not really caring what direction it leads to… which sums up this record pretty well I think :)</li>
</ul>
