<h1>mini notes for this is happening</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I&#39;m not really sure how to describe it, but I love this starting track for the shape of this LP- the waving in between subtle, quiet verses and explosive hooks is a great balance :)</li>
	<li>there&#39;s something so new and fresh about this so far, approaching the second half of one touch- while I might not be thrown to the edge of space with this LP, it can certainly feel like it at times</li>
	<li>the more down to earth styling of all i want is really fresh, and feels like such a housewarming type of track :D</li>
	<li>the stylistic jumps between casual, almost analogue sounding moments to intense, driving synth melody and harmony is a great aesthetic to go along with this whole record</li>
	<li>and of course, the long winding nature of a lot of these tracks are what makes them feel so special ^^</li>
	<li>haha the playful nature of pow pow just seems subtly genius- all of that morphs into sustaining steady breakdowns with the vocals :O</li>
	<li>the obama line really ties this all together (:</li>
	<li>the constant waving in between shocking out-of-tune and perfectly resonant synth drives in somebody&#39;s calling me feels both incredibly frustrating and lovingly beautiful- so I think it succeeded</li>
	<li>and damn... after the romp that that was, right into home; it all just feels... like home (((:</li>
</ul>
