<h1>mini notes for eat ya veggies</h1>

<ul>
	<li>oooh that little vocal sample is a great start- this whole beat and aesthetic is so catchy :D

		<ul>
			<li>I did think you were gonna say something ;(</li>
			<li>obviously this isn’t the most epic deep project ever, but jesus the fusion of pretty much just modern pop and hip-hop is pulled off really well</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>is that the second fantano line in a row?</li>
	<li>not feeling yoga nearly as much, it feels way too overproduced in a way too squeaky clean kind of way :/</li>
	<li>edamame though? very nice :)

		<ul>
			<li>that latin pop sort of beat behind this is incredibly appealing, the whole aesthetic of the track is rly damn good ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>black eyed peas isn’t any standout I think, but the instrumental is yet again pretty good- I think some of the bars are a bit too meh but the aesthetic is all there</li>
	<li>brainless is honestly one of the better tracks so far imo, but I can’t help just feel a bit taken aback in terms of the general feeling of the LP

		<ul>
			<li>the instrumentals keep being really damn good though :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>jesus christ the beat on u mad! is insane; I love this so much :O

		<ul>
			<li>the cs:go influence is great too ;)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly almost every track here starts a little borderline with me, but turns into something I find myself really liking I think; 2 time zones is no exception, and that feature from night lovell is really good :)</li>
	<li>and of course check up sort of destroys that for me; this is close to yoga tier for me unfortunately :/

		<ul>
			<li>that slowdown breakdown is pretty good, but I’m just already not feeling this track as much ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>big boss baby is similar; it’s an earworm, but not always in the best way it can be- and it’s not a long-lasting sort of remembrance too</li>
	<li>i remember is a pretty good sort of ballad, I think sort of what the stylings of yoga could’ve been- I know they have completely different points, but I like the general aesthetic of i remember much better</li>
	<li>wussup is a classic; it’s not bbno$ and gravy’s best collaboration obviously, but it’s incessantly catchy and iconic :)</li>
	<li>the last track here is a garbage collector though, what the hell is this ending :c</li>
</ul>
