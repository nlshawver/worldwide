<h1>mini notes for section.80</h1>

<ul>
	<li>oh my god... I don&#39;t even know what to say for these first three tracks; A.D.H.D. caps the start off well, but all of these cuts have a kind of careful consideration and very deliberate feel to them :D

		<ul>
			<li>and my god if the instrumentals and samples aren&#39;t wonderful ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the double entendres are just so easy coming from kendrick&#39;s vocals- but jesus christ that second verse on no makeup is absolutely crushing... :o</li>
	<li>chapter six is a great, subtle shift over to ronald reagan era... but that cut is just so insanely detailed, I love it ^</li>
	<li>the storytelling throughout poe man dreams is equally as impressive imo (and the &quot;my simplest shit be more pivotal&quot; line is just... perfect)

		<ul>
			<li>glc has a great few parts on this cut too, his presence is a nice second voice in this piece</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while the spiteful chant is definitely not my favorite cut, I have to be honest in saying the beat is insane and a lot of the verses are great as usual ^

		<ul>
			<li>holy shit how is schoolboy q so good on other people&#39;s tracks :D</li>
			<li>that combo verse just turned around this track, I love this now :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I have no words for keisha&#39;s song... it just has such immense power behind it</li>
	<li>it is slightly weird it goes right into rigamortus, but I&#39;m not complaining because rigamortus is such an insane, lyrically-dense romp of swagger :D

		<ul>
			<li>THE BASS :OOO</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>kush and corinthians honestly surprised me a lot, I adore that third verse and into bj&#39;s verse- kendrick just feels so slick during the verse and comes to in a very maddening inflection during the chorus :O</li>
	<li>both blow my high and ab-soul&#39;s outro are lovingly crafted, but each have their own strengths I think as ending pieces- and my god if jazz doesn&#39;t fit so perfectly with kendrick&#39;s cadence and emotion :D

		<ul>
			<li>thank u terrace martin for the sax ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and hiipower caps this thing off so mf well... the repeating lines from verse to verse and kendrick delivery together makes this so much of a fantastical finishing track :)</li>
</ul>
