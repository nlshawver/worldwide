<h1>mini notes for room on fire</h1>

<ul>
	<li>despite the positive review of their debut record <em>is this it,</em> I think I still was a bit too harsh on it for calling it par for the course in terms of indie/alt rock—just the first moments of <em>what ever happened?</em> are captivating in its own unique aesthetic, and I really like it :)</li>
	<li>and I feel like it’s absolutely necessary to point out that for such a record to only be thirty-two minutes is a shocking amount of restraint; this thing could easily be much longer, but it never wastes a moment of your time ^</li>
	<li>oh shit I know reptilia, this is a banger; best track of the two so far :D</li>
	<li>automatic stop is a great emotive follow-up, with that tinge of despair coming through really well at the end ^^</li>
	<li>jesus this record is exactly what I needed rn- 12:51 isn&#39;t my favorite here, but it&#39;s still a great cut and its ending is as great as the others present; you talk way too much is a fantastic little ballad in the middle of this absolute romp :)</li>
	<li>while it&#39;s not as close to it&#39;s preceding track&#39;s simplicity, between love and hate has a really endearing swagger that bookends the cut nicely ^^</li>
	<li>that&#39;s what she said

		<ul>
			<li>shit i dropped my ipod</li>
			<li>but that was a good track</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>under control is somehow really unique and interesting despite the extremely similar styles- I feel like I might love this LP</li>
	<li>I don&#39;t know what to say about the way it is, it&#39;s just good ^^</li>
	<li>and both ending tracks are wonderful, what an incredible finishing duo :)</li>
</ul>
