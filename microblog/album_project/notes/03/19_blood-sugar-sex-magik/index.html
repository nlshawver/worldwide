<h1>mini notes for blood sugar sex magik</h1>

<ul>
	<li>wow I wasn’t expecting much from the power of equality, but this track alone is already stellar :O

		<ul>
			<li>great transition to if you have to ask :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while I’m not as big a fan of breaking the girl, the vocals from anthony kiedis really shine on this track I think :)</li>
	<li>I feel like funky monks is the low point so far, in all honesty… it’s just really not necessary to this progression I guess :/

		<ul>
			<li>it’s not a bad track in any sense of the world, but it’s just not as adventurous or meaningful compared to the other tracks surrounding it</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while suck my kiss can occasionally give a great sort of ostentatious aspect that can be endearing, it gets a bit grating relatively quickly; this is the weak spot of the record no doubt</li>
	<li>i could have lied is a surprisingly good, subtle cut coming after that, and I think adds a great deal of complexity to the sound of this LP :)</li>
	<li>god, mellowship slinky in b major is a such a fantastic deep cut :D

		<ul>
			<li>THE BASS :DDD</li>
			<li>I really just can’t get enough of the general excitement this track pulls from the depths of its character :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the righteous &amp; the wicked I think is a really good follow-up to it; it’s almost more serious and compelling with the vocals, instead of focusing so much on the complexity and weaving of frusciante and flea on the previous track ^

		<ul>
			<li>both are great for different reasons, and the guitar still slaps on this :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>it’s a bit of a joking classic, but give it away will never not be at least compelling (and it’s so damn fun to imitate and sing to :)</li>
	<li>the title track feels like a great sort of proclamation especially with the guitar work in and around the chorus- it’s not a standout experience, but it’s a great splitter, dividing the first act and the remaining material</li>
	<li>under the bridge is a masterpiece- seriously, from the specific tonal journeys on frusciante’s guitar, the meaning of what kiedis is conveying… it’s a great, anthemic cut that defines this era and tonality of rhcp perfectly, while being a fantastic story :D

		<ul>
			<li>god that choir breakdown is beautiful :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>naked in the rain felt like a good progression (which is surprising since idk how you would come back from under the bridge), but I wasn’t necessarily blown away with apache rose peacock</li>
	<li>but damn if the greeting song didn’t have some of the best instrumentation post-under-the-bridge :)</li>
	<li>my lovely man was another pretty good cut to start closing out this LP, but I can’t not point out the mushy, wet bass on sir psycho sexy; it’s so good :D

		<ul>
			<li>and somehow I think the long track duration is very justified and fits well for this… giving time for the instruments to breathe for a while at the end adds a lot to how this LP closes up</li>
			<li>they’re red hot kinda destroys that, but the fact that it’s a pretty much a joke skit track, I’ll give it a pass lol</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
