<h1>mini notes for saturation III</h1>

<ul>
	<li>holy shit boogie is already an instantly recognizable, hugely catchy introduction :D</li>
	<li>I already really like the thematic and aesthetic choices of that and zipper, both are lovely starting cuts :)

		<ul>
			<li>hahaha &quot;head was clean, tony fantano&quot; I love it</li>
			<li>I also rly like the &quot;best boy band since one direction&quot; line on boogie :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>these instrumentals are amazing, honestly- it&#39;s been a continual improvement, and this LP feels the best developed so far ^</li>
	<li>liquid is a great lil interlude, very nice :)</li>
	<li>español</li>
	<li>stupid is another good cut; it&#39;s not as standout to me as the LP&#39;s introduction, but it&#39;s still very good (esp thematically w the verses)</li>
	<li>bleach was even better with the subject matter and just its general intonations; it feels genuinely pained and I love that about it</li>
	<li>yea what the fuck is grey poupon?

		<ul>
			<li>ye we do really like rap</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while it&#39;s not my favorite instrumental, alaska has a lot of really good lines strewn throughout it; prop :)</li>
	<li>hottie&#39;s pretty hot too; nice lil pop track ^</li>
	<li>español dos</li>
	<li>jesus... sister/nation is an insane trip, but I love it for that and all that vocal and instrumental quirks it has :)</li>
	<li>rental&#39;s vocal start is rly rly good, and that crunchy lil instrumental is lovely too ^^</li>
	<li>I don&#39;t know what it is about the stature of it, but stains is one of my favorite cuts on the back end of this project... it just sounds so direct and emotive :))

		<ul>
			<li>I guess it helps that the instrumental is incredibly infectious, but idk</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>español très</li>
	<li>oh my god... I was not expecting that ethereal bliss on team, what an incredible outro :O

		<ul>
			<li>maybe I was a bit more boxed in when listening to the other two saturations, but maybe this is just the best one of the three :D</li>
			<li>the bars that come through after the beat switch are incredible too, they feel especially forceful in their meaning while still sounding smooth as butter ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
