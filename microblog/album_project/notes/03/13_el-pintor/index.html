<h1>mini notes for el pintor</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I’ve got it: I don’t think any of the songs on the three interpol albums I’ve listened to are bad, I’m just rarely in the mood for this type of rock I think</li>
	<li>because all the rage back home is a great introductory track, and I love the styling with the floating guitar line throughout the whole track… tbf I think I may have been too harsh to those last albums, they deserve more credit than I gave them

		<ul>
			<li>my desire is genuinely a pretty good follow-up too :)</li>
			<li>god I need to give this band more credit; I think a critique I will never make is that these records ever felt creatively barren or tired, because there’s always something there to latch onto and feel attached too</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while my notes dry up (time restraints and increased interest in articulating my points for the primary image post) moments throughout the record continue to impress me in a great kind of way

		<ul>
			<li>honestly all of the tracks seem interesting in one way or another, with cuts like my blue supreme and breaker 1 having a great amount of interesting energy (even if I personally love my blue supreme much more)</li>
			<li>it might be temporary enjoyment for this record specifically, but if it means that I gain a new appreciation for interpol’s older discography, I don’t mind that much</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
