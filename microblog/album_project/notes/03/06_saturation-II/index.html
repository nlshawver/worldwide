<h1>mini notes for saturation II</h1>

<ul>
	<li>holy hell gummy is a fantastic start- all the bars sound effortlessly smooth, and the almost unhinged instrumental is lovely :D</li>
	<li>I like a lot of the playful lyrics that weave themselves into most of these starting tracks; it’s a very cohesive, slightly more unique start than I remember compared to the first saturation :)</li>
	<li>I was a bit taken aback by the start of jello, but OH MY GOD that instrumental is absolutely jaw-dropping; the little spoken pieces of teeth and scene are pretty great moments too, they feel simplistically introspective</li>
	<li>honestly tokyo just feels like a bit of a patched-up work of brockhampton’s already realized styles, and I don’t think it’s in a fully positive way; it just felt like a nice moment</li>
	<li>I really do like these tiny interludes, they match up with the style very, very well :)</li>
	<li>junky, while definitely not my favorite track right now, has such an intense, intimate theme that feels so clearly aimed in its subject matter :O

		<ul>
			<li>and the instrumental does bang at just the right moments ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and after that second scene, into fight- I love that element of the LP; while sweet initially didn’t feel like it initially fit it very well, it’s turned into a very nice track here towards the end :)</li>
	<li>I really do love a lot of the structure that rears its head into the ending of this record, especially on gamba—it’s not the most interesting track here in my opinion, but the emotion and touching little beats and harmonies are lovely :)

		<ul>
			<li>it ends off on a bit of a melancholic, understated culmination of the entire emotion of the record</li>
			<li>I don’t think the whole record itself is always outstanding, but this end certainly feels the part</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
