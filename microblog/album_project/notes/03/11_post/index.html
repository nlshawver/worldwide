<h1>mini notes for post</h1>

<ul>
	<li>while I wasn’t blown away with army of me quite yet, I can’t help but love the soundscape formed with its driving synths- that all soon decay into hyperballad</li>
	<li>I really do like hyperballad, but there’s something cold and somber about the modern things that ties this record’s start together in a nice package to me :)

		<ul>
			<li>the vocal cries that end the second chorus and outro are incredible :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>woah what the hell… I am so caught off guard with this 50’s cover :OO

		<ul>
			<li>it’s really damn good tho; I’m pleasantly with that :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the cut of enjoy going right back into the huge synthesizer lines is a jarring but compelling change of pace ^^</li>
	<li>wow, and I adore the very slow and calculated build up on you’ve been flirting again, it’s so volatile yet rigid :)

		<ul>
			<li><strong>especially</strong> as an intro to isobel, woah :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yea isobel just piqued by interest a ton, that was incredible…</li>
	<li>and possibly maybe is a great continuation and growth after it ^</li>
	<li>i miss you is another great moment I think, it was that sort of wonderful experience in the way it morphs that’s so common on this record</li>
	<li>headphones is such a great ending cut to this LP, I don’t even really have words for it- it’s just kind of an experience to be had on your own</li>
</ul>
