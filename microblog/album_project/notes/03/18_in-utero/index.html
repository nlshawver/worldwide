<h1>mini notes for in utero</h1>

<ul>
	<li>serve the servants takes a really good starter position on this record, with the chaos that ensues almost immediately serving as a fantastic re-ascension for a final LP :)</li>
	<li>jesus christ the screams on scentless apprentice are absolutely wretched, I can’t not appreciate the grating cacophony :O</li>
	<li>heart-shaped box I think is the only radio hit from this record (besides maybe it’s successor on the tracklist, toned down), and it absolutely deserves the recognition

		<ul>
			<li>especially after its predecessor, it’s a surprising and eccentric comeback from what is essentially hell on the last track</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly I was a bit let down from what I remember rape me to be, and how I was expecting it to wring from the subtle yet aggressive sound… but it’s obviously not bad at all, and frances farmer will have her revenge on seattle right after is a banger follow-up :D</li>
	<li>also, did not realize I knew dumb- this is another great cut here :)

		<ul>
			<li>that cello is an absolutely wonderful addition to this track, I love it so much more with that added complexity :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>very ape is a great bordering-on-interlude into the off-putting disorder of milk it; it’s such a creeping, immense experience with cobain’s vocals sauntering under everything… until that chorus :O

		<ul>
			<li>that CHUCKLE :DDD</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>pennyroyal tea is of course also a great hit to this record… this LP somehow lives up completely to its predecessor :O</li>
	<li>radio friendly unit shifter and tourette’s are, as the latter name suggests, are chaotic messes—but they’re absolutely beautiful :)</li>
	<li>all apologies is such a beautiful closer for this record

		<ul>
			<li>it may not have the broad strokes of the other hits here, but the simple melody and sustained bass turn this into an incredibly poignant send-off</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
