<h1>mini notes for malibu</h1>

<ul>
	<li>the bird is such a great introduction to this record and paak&#39;s style, and heart don&#39;t stand a chance just follows so well right in its footsteps :)</li>
	<li>it&#39;s hard to describe the slick sort of style and skill anderson paak has, but jesus if the waters doesn&#39;t show it off perfectly :O</li>
	<li>and somehow it keeps getting better with the easy feel of the season / carry me... LOVE that k.dot line (and the flow that follows) :D</li>
	<li>have to compliment the bass throughout this whole record so far, it&#39;s a bit under and away from the mesh, but it&#39;s ever-present and feels absolutely lovely to my ears~</li>
	<li>and oh my god what a transition in between put me thru and am i wrong

		<ul>
			<li>outstanding feature from schoolboy q too :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the rapsody feature has a great, powerful sort of articulation that contrasts paak&#39;s styling in a rly nice way- but god damn parking lot is a classic :)</li>
	<li>honestly light weight is the only sort of underselling cut here so far in the first half hour- but only in the fact that it’s a bit minimal and almost like a long interlude</li>
	<li>room in here feels just coated in braggadocious swagger, I love it :)

		<ul>
			<li>I don’t know what it is about it, but the game somehow fits really damn well in here :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>actual interlude moment; haha I love when the vocals come in on your prime, so jokingly real and genuinely funny :)</li>
	<li>what the hell is the start of silicon valley HAHAHA

		<ul>
			<li>that knocked it down by half a star all by itself lmao</li>
			<li>I have no idea how this cut can sound so mf impressive with such outlandish, ridiculous lyrics :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the dreamer is absolutely wonderful, it’s a great sort of romp with a legend that all just ends on a high note :)</li>
	<li>it’s a great but weird set of ending tracks, I love it &lt;3</li>
</ul>
