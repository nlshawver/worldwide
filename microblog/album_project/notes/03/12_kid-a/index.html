<h1>mini notes for kid a</h1>

<ul>
	<li>not sure how to describe this start either- the weaving that takes place in the first cut is really nice, and the subtleties of the title track are too :)</li>
	<li>I do really like the soundscapes that develop with the increased use of synths on this record, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m connecting or meshing with this record as much as I did on ok computer</li>
	<li>I&#39;m especially a fan of that instrumental intro track into optimistic tho, that was rly damn good :O</li>
	<li>yea besides maybe the intro track, optimistic is my favorite track here so far :)

		<ul>
			<li>and I love that in limbo feels (and pretty much is) an adventurous continuation of optimistic ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>through all that artistic merit shown across this whole project, and how lovely that ending was, I can&#39;t not love this thing :D</li>
