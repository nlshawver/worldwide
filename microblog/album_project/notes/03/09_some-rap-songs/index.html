<h1>mini notes for some rap songs</h1>

<ul>
	<li>it wasn&#39;t honestly until cold summers that I started to actually appreciate the sometimes grating experimental style of this project</li>
	<li>december 24 was another cut like that, I like the subtle, muted styles of both it and ontheway! right after</li>
	<li>the mint and loosie are both good- but my god this tracklist is flying by :O</li>
	<li>azucar is a great cut too, maybe my favorite so far :)</li>
	<li>eclipse and veins—while very similar—are both really good too ^^</li>
	<li>and while peanut was a bit weird, riot! left me absolutely stunned and confused with the meaning of this whole LP</li>
</ul>
