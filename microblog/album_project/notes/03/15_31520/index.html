<h1>mini notes for 3.15.20</h1>

<ul>
	<li>okay, interesting but almost a nothing intro for 0.00</li>
	<li>damn alright, algorhythm came in with much more of an interesting aesthetic than I expected compared to 0.00; that&#39;s not bad :o</li>
	<li>not a bad transition, but that ending felt chaotic for no apparent reason; I&#39;m just confused at this things onset, and not in a good way</li>
	<li>I like time, and the feature is great- but I just feel like it doesn&#39;t fully justify its runtime much (even if I&#39;m definitely adding it to my march playlist)</li>
	<li>I do think the almost conversational, casual sound of 12.38 compliments quite well... and 21 is good as usual :)</li>
	<li>okay okay, that was a really well made transition; I&#39;m still not fully sold, and I&#39;m not a huge fan of the vocal intonation, but I&#39;ve not set this aside at all yet</li>
	<li>I don&#39;t know the words to describe how I&#39;m feeling rn, but 19.10 is a good follow-up :)</li>
	<li>an almost soulful track, I think 24.19 kinda keeps things fresh in a record that already seems to know exactly what it wants to do</li>
	<li>while I only really like bits and pieces of 32.22 (mainly the way it starts and the wild nature of its &#39;chorus,&#39;) I can&#39;t fault it for not being sonically adventurous</li>
	<li>uhhh okay 35.31 was not at all what I was thinking of what would be coming next- I like the playfulness when it comes in over a punchy beat, but the preceding two minutes weren&#39;t a high point</li>
	<li>39.28 is a good continuation of the light elements of its predecessor; while I was doubtful of 42.26 at first, its verses and very ~vibe~ aesthetic is nice :)</li>
	<li>and wow 47.48 is a stellar follow-up… I hate that I very often come to the point that a lot of records feel bookended in their interest and sonic journeys, but I do think the third- and second-last tracks on this record constitute their own praise</li>
	<li>wow okay, not the ending that was expected… while I was a bit grossed out at first with the way more upbeat tone, thinking it should fade out, I think it might have been a good way to close in a memorable way</li>
	<li>and I guess that’s all that there is of this musical persona… yea I know camp, but there’s not much to see there</li>
</ul>
