<h1>mini notes for fleet foxes</h1>

<ul>
	<li>sun it rises is genuinely a fantastic start to this LP, I&#39;m loving every part of this :D

		<ul>
			<li>the combo of subtle and wonderfully bombastic everything (vocals, guitar, instrumental) morph in a great way ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ngl I was worried with white winter hymnal at first because of the almost church-vibe of it, but it very quickly dashed any fears with a unique energy to match that inherently catchy groove :)</li>
	<li>while I&#39;m not as blown away by ragged wood, the way it stretches and fills its runtime is amazing ^^

		<ul>
			<li>okay the lyrics are actually incredible- I love this one now :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>tiger mountain peasant song is a wonderfully lovely cut that almost feels like a spoken word journey- another really good track here ^</li>
	<li>quiet houses, counterintuitively, is a great upbeat comeback from tiger; I love it :)</li>
	<li>I don&#39;t know what it is about it, but he doesn&#39;t know why is another fantastic track; everything here has a great sensibility in its specific styling, and I&#39;m adoring every moment :D</li>
	<li>while not necessarily a massive build-up, the interlude of heard them stirring is great in its own right ^</li>
	<li>I don&#39;t think your protector was a standout hit, but yet again it&#39;s a good song in a good placement on this LP ^</li>
	<li>meadowlarks though is a stunningly somber cut, I love the layered vocals throughout w the subtle guitar lines :))</li>
	<li>this is one of the few albums that never has a lacking moment, nothing that feels like it could&#39;ve been skipped or altered along the journey</li>
	<li>oh my god the buildup on blue ridge mountains is absolutely beautiful :D

		<ul>
			<li>it&#39;s like the perfect release from the emotions shown on the previous tracks- it&#39;s so loving and incredibly attuned :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the perfect ending- a countertop conversation filled with emotive back-and-forths and detailed stories</li>
	<li>I may have a bit of recency bias on my discovery bias on fleet foxes... but I think the rating this gets is absolutely deserved :)</li>
</ul>
