<h1>mini notes for vespertine</h1>

<ul>
	<li>oh my god wow, I was not expecting this start… I wasn’t initially impressed as much by the start of hidden place, but that second chorus just exploded :O

		<ul>
			<li>that instrumental is so incredible, I don’t know how to even describe it… everything comes together amazingly :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that was a bit sexual (:</li>
	<li>but it’s not up to you is a bit more like hidden place, it’s huge chorus feels almost perfect after the flowing verses ^

		<ul>
			<li>it’s not as substantial as hidden place, but the progression it provides in the LP (especially into undo) is really damn good :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yea undo is rly good :)

		<ul>
			<li>it didn’t initially stick out to me a ton, and the midsection was a bit of the same, but the ending third morphs into something more than the sum of its parts ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>pagan poetry starts really, really well though with those bass lines and harmonic voices, and the little metal keys :D

		<ul>
			<li>some part of it leaves a little left to be desired in my mind, but I’m not sure what…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>frosti, while obviously not a huge track in its stature, still provides something really great to the pacing here :)</li>
	<li>björk’s singing on aurora is by far her most beautiful I’ve heard it, jesus :D

		<ul>
			<li>I’m speechless, those melodies in the chorus are jaw-dropping…</li>
			<li>this may be my favorite björk song, bar none ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the jump right from that to an echo a stain is insane though, that warbling bass line is such a shift :O</li>
	<li>and it feels like sun in my mouth is like a culmination and combination of the last two tracks, I love that aesthetic choice :)

		<ul>
			<li>it’s like a reprise, or outro to a mini arc in the narrative of this LP ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ya know there might be some sexual connotations in this record, I’m not sure

		<ul>
			<li>but honestly heirloom is another fantastic track, it’s at least very close to my third favorite track so far- the interesting breakbeat behind it is a confusing but exceedingly compelling choice behind these vocal lines :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>harm of will is an incredible second-to-last ballad… the strings will never not get me :O

		<ul>
			<li>the harmonies explored throughout the song are incredible too, oh my god…</li>
			<li>it’s so overtly sexual and vulgar, yet everything about it feels like such a personal connection, way more than just that of those choice lines</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>unison is such an exciting yet perfectly attuned track as an ending… the meaning behind the track—feeling nothing without your partner after they changed fundamentally how you feel—it’s a somber prospect in theory but the way björk describes it and makes the whole thing feel… it’s a wonderful ending, we’ll just say that :)</li>
</ul>
