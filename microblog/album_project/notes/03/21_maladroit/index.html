<h1>mini notes for maladroit</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I definitely over-rated the green album…</li>
	<li>what a wonderfully slightly-above-average yet heavy start to this record… might just be first listening, but this feels like it’s just kinda sitting there, even if it is unique and nice on american gigolo</li>
	<li>dope nose was recorded right around the time of hash pipe, and it very clearly shows through on this track- it’s a nice little callback, and the power pop is a great hit :)</li>
	<li>keep fishin’ is a good continuation and somehow a ramp up from the previous track; the sway of the vocals fits with this edging-on-perfect instrumental

		<ul>
			<li>the muppet music video really ties this together well</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh the starting vocals for take control are great, I love it :D

		<ul>
			<li>yea oh my god, that was better than everything off of the green album, even if the nostalgia of its two known tracks supersedes its recognition</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>death and destruction has a good little instrumental behind it too, and the lyrics and articulation really turn this into something more than the sum of its parts I feel

		<ul>
			<li>even the way it fades out is really nice, I like that a lot :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>slob was a great piece as well, but it’s one I think I need to delve a little more into in detail to appreciate more</li>
	<li>but damn the change-up for burndt jamb is so lovely, what the hell :D

		<ul>
			<li>I can’t get the smile off my face for how this feels ^</li>
			<li>AH THAT GUITAR LINE :O</li>
			<li>this song’s theme is really mf sad, but it doesn’t matter anymore; it’s too good, you don’t need that rn dude, you’re strong</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I should’ve expected a track like space rock to show up after that; I don’t think it’s the best track here by a mile (esp with some of the vocal harmony at the onset), but it’s definitely worthwhile</li>
	<li>slave is another track just like that I think, it has a compelling instrumental even if it just kinda slides into the tracklist</li>
	<li>fall together starts with a fantastic riff though :O

		<ul>
			<li>and the fact that it feels so tied to possibilities right after it is a great touch :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow yea this ending, while the songs individually mesh together more-so than I think compliments their stylings on their own, I can’t not appreciate the story melding from fall together, to possibilities, to love explosion, to december

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a heavy sort of set, filled with raw emotion feeling like a mix that sits right between blue and pinkerton</li>
			<li>it might not be as well-oiled or endearingly chaotic as those two, but it’s lovely in its own right :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
