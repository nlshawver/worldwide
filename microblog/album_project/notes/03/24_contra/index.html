<h1>mini notes for contra</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I’m not sure how much I fully remember about my experience with vampire weekend’s debut, but this feels like a less chamber-y, nice sort of start with horchata :)</li>
	<li>white sky feels like a pleasant, not too excited or over-bearing pop track… I like it, but I’m not seeing the huge hype around this record yet in all honesty—</li>
	<li>that futura line on holiday is incredible tho :D

		<ul>
			<li>holiday is my favorite track here so far, I’m starting to get into it a little more :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow okay, california english is somehow explosive compared to what’s been here so far- I kinda like it :)

		<ul>
			<li>the huge reverb over some complex lines is both endearing and confusingly chaotic ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>taxi cab is… I don’t even know, it’s a loving, saddening ballad of sorts about such a confusing, close relationship- and it’s so relatable because it’s not either person’s fault, it just didn’t work out…

		<ul>
			<li>best track here so far in terms of meaning ^^</li>
			<li>the repeated “like an aristocrat” callback is really nice, like they’ve gone through everything, and now it’s a joking, friendly sort of ending about those same experiences they bonded over…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>run is a fitting progression, I love it :)</li>
	<li>and damn if cousins isn’t incredible in its guitar riffs and chaotic intonation— but woah… the instrumental change to giving up the gun :O

		<ul>
			<li>this four track run from taxi cab to here is insane ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the way this kind of grows and morphs with its sounds and instruments feels really nice- it’s nothing outstanding or shuddering, but it’s a great, pleasant sound :)</li>
	<li>huh, diplomat’s son starts in a way that’s both completely expected, yet still unique and interesting—good stuff

		<ul>
			<li>I don’t think it’s my favorite track here by a decent margin, but the chopped and slowed instrumentation halfway through changes things up in a great way—this is a very interesting, explorative cut :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>i think ur a contra feels like a beautiful sort of ending… I’m still not completely sold on the great stature this album has been given by other publications, but it’s certainly one of vampire weekend’s best (and I liked it more than the debut)

		<ul>
			<li>:)</li>
		</ul></li>
