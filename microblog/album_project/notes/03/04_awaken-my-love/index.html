<h1>mini notes for &quot;awaken, my love!&quot;</h1>

<ul>
	<li>wow, very pleasantly surprised by these two starting tracks :O</li>
	<li>the very obvious blending of jazz, neo soul, funk, and r&amp;b seems to honestly come off without hitch, uninhibited by any lacking creative skills from Glover :)</li>
	<li>jesus christ Redbone is an instant classic :D

		<ul>
			<li>it’s such a good mid-section track that compliments the rest of the tracklist (even if I think the track before and after it are meh)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>especially after… I am really not feeling this :/</li>
	<li>Zombies and California just felt off and a bit out-of-place, but Terrified is a great little return to what I knew this record was capable of achieving; the instrumentation (especially that bass line and choice of instruments) and vocals are great :)</li>
	<li>have to give a shout out to a lot of the transitions here too, they’re really damn good ^</li>
	<li>and wow, Baby Boy is a wonderful deep cut here; it contains every single element that makes Redbone so good, and completes that same sort of feeling in a unique way :D</li>
	<li>every single track after Redbone besides California was pretty great in its own way; and the whole LP had a winding, confusing, but pleasant ending</li>
</ul>
