<h1>mini notes for the divine feminine</h1>

<ul>
	<li>that&#39;s an interesting, almost convoluted (by the end) sort of sound and theme; I like the laidback swagger it has, especially with the anderson paak feature right after on the second track :)</li>
	<li>yea this second cut is great, down to the subtle synth choices :D</li>
	<li>uhhh outside of that ending(?) I thought Stay was a really well made follow-up; and the more somber feeling start to Skin is great too ^</li>
	<li>it&#39;s a long and winding sort of progression, but both Cinderella and Planet God Damn were absolutely wonderful :D</li>
	<li>damn and that ceelo green feature fits perfectly here (and love to have the tiniest of features from Thundercat :))</li>
	<li>that kendrick &amp; mac ending is lovely too ^^</li>
</ul>
