<h1>mini notes for i like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it</h1>

<ul>
	<li>what a slick, effortlessly catchy, and uniquely detailed start with these first three cuts :)</li>
	<li>while I wasn&#39;t necessarily sold on the following handful of tracks, it does sorta feel like a well-articulated disco dreamscape</li>
	<li>I was trying to find the words to articulate what I was feeling, but I think I found them: while a lot of the details and progression of the over-arching elements here felt great at times, some felt criminally underdeveloped in their stature- like this sort of wild and at-times confusing structure needed a bit more time in the oven</li>
</ul>
