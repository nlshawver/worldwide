<h1>mini notes for ds2</h1>

<ul>
	<li>bruh that’s where that line came from hahaha

		<ul>
			<li>ngl though thought it was a drought is a great introduction with the very obvious introduction; the beat and production feels very typical for future, but in all honesty this was still when he was rising in popularity (I think)</li>
			<li>I might not be a huge fan of future’s inflection on this track, but I’m not opposed to it I think</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit– it took me a second to really feel the instrumental, but that craggy, super-compressed beat behind these woes of dealing cocaine… it’s more powerful and shocking than I was expecting :O</li>
	<li>“I take attendance like a classroom” bruh this is another reason I’m not fond of drake lmao

		<ul>
			<li>in all honesty though his feature is not bad, it’s a nice pair on this very obviously intoned banger; it’s probably my least favorite track of the starting three, but it continues all the themes well</li>
			<li>that simple beat is nice :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ehh not feeling groupies much; although it’s as earth-shattering as the last few cuts were syrupy and tinny in their aesthetics, which is a very good plus

		<ul>
			<li>god the second half goes off really well though, and that huge bass line finishing it out is insane :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>lil one starts really nicely too, that drum beat is so damn good :o

		<ul>
			<li>the mini bridge before the last chorus ties this together well, another rly good cut I think :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh I know this one :D

		<ul>
			<li>that mf instrumental (strings?) in front of this beat, sandwiched under future’s bars is absolutely incredible- this is probably the best track here bar one in the leading cut ^^</li>
			<li>god it all comes together perfectly, and I didn’t think I would like this album much at all :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>is every single instrumental here just incredible? all of them are covered in this unique, super-compelling psychedelic, drugged-out energy that feels like nothing else could suit it; the weakest tracks on this LP so far all still sound amazing :)</li>
	<li>rotation is alright tho; it’s probably the cut that blends in here the most, but I don’t think it’s bad per se</li>
	<li>slave master feels retrospective in its purpose; I think that’s a lot of the themes here tho, which compliments this track’s purpose

		<ul>
			<li>it’s obviously just about drugs, sex, money, etc., but almost every cut has that piece of small desperation and almost a tinge of regret and longing… I’m not sure entirely if that’s true, but almost certainly it has the sense of it in future’s lines and delivery</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>unfortunately tho I think blow a bag might fit in a similar place to rotation for me- the beat substitutes a lot of the shortcomings in the chorus for me, but there’s a great set of lines in the verses

		<ul>
			<li>“Money&#39;ll change a n––, the fame&#39;ll change a bitch / I know I came from poverty, I got my name from poverty”</li>
			<li>jesus christ that bass line just rose above the rest of the track for a bit, and my god that sound was lovely :D</li>
			<li>yea nvm that’s a late LP favorite from me :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the shimmering instrumental and piano sections from colossal are its best focal points imo; future is good here as always, but it’s just sort of in the mix (but more standout than rotation though)</li>
	<li>rich sex fits in a similar place; both tracks have great instrumentals, but aren’t nearly as shocking or uniquely toned as some other cuts here

		<ul>
			<li>it is still a very good outroduction though</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my god… the huge amount of instruments on blood on the money is incredible to listen develop

		<ul>
			<li>the bass work and tape winding of some sections, seething vocal lines, then the pieces of flute, piano, strings… it’s all amazing :))</li>
			<li>what a stellar end to a landmark trap record :D</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
