<h1>mini notes for emma, forever ago</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I&#39;m not sure how precisely I was expecting this LP to sound, begin, or anything of the sort... but flume is a great initiation :)</li>
	<li>the vocals on lump sum really tie the track together well, but I can&#39;t help but feel especially with the start of skinny love that this record feels like an anthology

		<ul>
			<li>I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s good or bad tho</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>skinny love is rly damn good tho :O</li>
	<li>and wow... especially with how the wolves ended with the deep vocals off center stage, that felt like the most personal, heavy track here so far</li>
	<li>and blindsided isn&#39;t far off :O

		<ul>
			<li>yea oh my god, the chorus really tied that all together, and that may be my favorite track here so far (especially tied with its meaning after those two preceding tracks)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I’m glad that statement I made about it feeling anthological has aged like milk :)

		<ul>
			<li>creature fear is yet again disproving it; it feels like a culmination of the previous tracks, and like a response to blindsided ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>team is a good sort of interlude, it feels pleasant but off-setting in its discordant whistling :o</li>
	<li>I didn’t feel blown away by for emma, but I don’t think it’s a bad track at all- it’s just an expressive way to show the ending of this little project ^</li>
	<li>and re: stacks is a great bow to tie around this whole LP; the vocals really shine through the whole track (as with the rest of the album), and the raw feel of it altogether made for a great experience :)</li>
</ul>
