<h1>mini notes for m3ll155x</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I don’t even know what to think with figure 8; that harsh, explosive synth instrumental that shears into the track after her first verse is incredibly intense, and the following content continues in a really interesting, hard-to-describe way :o

		<ul>
			<li>just kinda at a loss for words for what this collectively is…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn, that grating patch in the final pre-chorus, that stems into that crescendo of the last chorus on i’m your doll is incredibly captivating

		<ul>
			<li>it’s such a weird, manic style that I think is both incredibly disjointed, but communicates these intense feelings really well; it’s a first listen, so I can’t possibly digest all that’s underlying here about past and present interpretations of love- but it has easily some of the most striking visuals (both lyrically and instrumentally) that I’ve heard in a little while :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god that chorus is incredible, w those repeated exclamations of “you’ve got a goddamn nerve” :ooo

		<ul>
			<li>this dense mf instrumental is so beautiful, I can’t get over how much it adds to this EP :D</li>
			<li>AND THE BEAT DROPPING OUT AND SWITCHING :O</li>
			<li>easily the most excitable track for me so far, and that slow fade to nothing is a great closer for the midpoint here ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit… no words for how almost haunting that hook on glass &amp; patron is :ooo

		<ul>
			<li>this whole track is a confusing web of articulate explosions, and I’m just in awe at how it comes together ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I don’t even have a thing to say about mothercreep; I’ve looked into a bit of what it’s getting at, and I’m just awestruck rn

		<ul>
			<li>was not expecting this level of density in an EP, and I’m just stepping back and thinking…</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
