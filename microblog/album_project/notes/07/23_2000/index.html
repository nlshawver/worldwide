<h1>mini notes for 2000</h1>

<ul>
	<li>okay, it’s just the opener, but the piano ringing throughout feels almost theatrical; when the beat finally comes in at the end, it feels like things are just starting after a pair of verses flaunting the influence, reintroducing this style</li>
	<li>damnn okay, that huge verse taking up all of make me feel is amazing, and a great sign for the rest of what’s to come :)

		<ul>
			<li>and a fantastic transition to the third track ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>along with being a really great follow-up to make me fell, where i belong has a great snippet from nenobia washington- and the connection to steez is almost harrowing coming after the two very solid verses prior :o</li>
	<li>goddamn I was not expecting to love a joey / westside gunn collaboration this much; the two timbres of their voices contrast amazingly, and both have great verses on brand new 911 :D</li>
	<li>ooh that sung hook from joey is a really nice pairing with this almost pop rap instrumental on cruise control :)

		<ul>
			<li>fantastic second verse too, damn—just great stuff all around ^</li>
			<li>and thank u mr nas c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>eulogy might be a bit more worn in the boom bap stylings—and honestly the persistent double hook is starting to become an expected facet of the record—but it’s still a lyrically dense and impressive track :)

		<ul>
			<li>even if honestly that last verse sounds like there’s a half vocal effect on his voice, making his voice sound harsher- it’s minor, but it was weird and stuck out pretty strong as the closer to that otherwise great cut ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and of course right when I say it—not only do we finally get a track close to five minutes, and a third verse oasis—the hook is a curt statement before reeling right back into magnificent lyrical work and a characteristically styled instrumental :D

		<ul>
			<li>best track so far, I love zipcodes c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and one of us—while it didn’t start too strong for me (since at times the production can feel close to shrill)—comes through with both some pretty good work from joey on the hook and verse, and honestly a really good feature from larry june; it’s another slight contrast that comes across pretty well (even if the ending of the verse is a bit… there)</li>
	<li>what the fuck is this…?

		<ul>
			<li>I don’t have anything to say about welcome back; I was already a bit touchy with the inclusion of diddy, but jesus christ… chris brown?</li>
			<li>both of joey’s verses are kinda weak, and both brown &amp; capella grey sound legitimately awful; it’s such a shitty experience in the mix of this otherwise pretty substantive record :(</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“Can&#39;t spell us without trust” I don’t care after that last track :/

		<ul>
			<li>I honestly can appreciate the theme of bittersweet relationship troubles as a result of his popularity and status… but for the love of god, not after you just told me every reason why I shouldn’t think of you as caring that much on the previous track</li>
			<li>in any other context a good song, but it’s pretty insincere to me; wasn’t even a memorable instrumental to latch onto…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>alright- even though I’m still thinking about that track, wanna be loved (despite the fact I’m still off-put by that title), the instrumental is pretty damn solid, and JID performs magic yet again; always love a feature from him :)</li>
	<li>and I think with head high, the awkwardness has worn off, and I can enjoy a genuinely great cut from joey; two very, very solid verses and another characteristic beat aren’t too adventurous, but it comes together with that indescribable, loose appeal ^</li>
	<li>damn- really great vocal and instrumental introduction on survivors guilt :o

		<ul>
			<li>and while some of the first verse can feel more spoken word than more detailed rhyming towards the midsection, I have no complaints; it really is a beautiful expression of remorse and mental anguish, and I will never criticize that so long as it’s told this goddamn well…</li>
			<li>and I have to say- beautiful intro from steez and outro from ab-soul; absolutely heart-wrenching stuff ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow, and genuinely another fantastic introduction on written in the stars :O

		<ul>
			<li>absolutely staggering verse, and just kinda floored at the one-two punch of these open-ended, vulnerable expressions of love and loss… definitely the most influential footprint of this entire record, and a touching end (despite diddy getting the last word) ^</li>
			<li>the runtime of these two is very much needed, and filled to the brim with ease c:</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
