<h1>mini notes for dead cities, red seas &amp; lost ghosts</h1>

<ul>
	<li>huh, interesting little vocal sample to start off this record</li>
	<li>that driving guitar work on unrecorded is an expansive way to start off the primary tracklist though; the synths that shine around that primary harmony come in perfectly, and the whole instrumental feels fantastical and extravagant in nature :D

		<ul>
			<li>that calmer, yet almost off-putting ending to the track is really nice too; overall a beautifully laden opener c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that loud, strident, and chaotic instrumental that grows from the introduction of run into flowers is another wild experience; when the vocal sample finally comes in towards the latter half, it feels confident in itself, and I love that :)</li>
	<li>we really do be in church tho

		<ul>
			<li>genuinely though, the way those synth chords come in and completely encapsulate and repackage that organ is absolutely incredible :o</li>
			<li>while I was bit stymied in having to review another record, this was the moment where I genuinely just laid back and appreciated what great musicianship is present here so far c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I don’t even know where to begin with america- the sample from that horror movie, the wild, almost frustrating first half, and the muddled, compressed explosion at the latter half… it’s certainly my least favorite track so far, but it’s definitely not the least interesting ^</li>
	<li>those exasperated synth harmonies, and the clicking drum machines of on a white lake, near a green mountain are effortlessly beautiful here; while I was almost frustrated at the middling nature of the harmony, never resolving- it honestly adds to a sort of constant mental state in an interesting way :o

		<ul>
			<li>beautiful cut, one of the better moments, and a good come-up from what I think may be the least good track here ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while I wasn’t initially sold on noise, the way it builds towards the end and that constant chord drowns out all else around it until it fades out was a really good closer to it all ^</li>
	<li>be wild in a way sort of seems to go nowhere, but the pleasant yet slightly off-kilter harmony folds into a nice package rather well :)</li>
	<li>cyborg was another one that had to grow for a bit, but that uproar of everything about the track felt almost unplanned and in the moment- that’s a hard thing to pull off… and while I think it’s styling wore thin, that was genuinely a great experience c:</li>
	<li>and that weird vocal play-through on 0078h is interesting too- I don’t know how to describe a lot of moments here, but they are, at the very least, all unique and different in their own way :)

		<ul>
			<li>yea 0078h might be one of my favorites- it’s such a contained chaos that’s unbridled in its tenacity :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the way that little progression wells to that serene uplifting after four minutes of runtime on gone… it’s a bit of a indulgent, lovely moment on the record :)

		<ul>
			<li>third favorite c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>those smooth vocals that start off beauties can die :oo

		<ul>
			<li>kinda beautiful, half-soaring sound for the first three minutes, but I’m surprised by how willing it is to stretch out this ethereal conclusion to the “full” track length… not because it’s too brave or confident, but in how sublime (in an understated sort of way) it can be :)</li>
			<li>…patiently waiting for this hidden track…</li>
			<li>pretty and grating at the same time :o pretty good closer, and a weird one at that— not much else to say, just some good material and a great, expansive track to end on</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
