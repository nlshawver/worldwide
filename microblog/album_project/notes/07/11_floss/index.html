<h1>mini notes for floss</h1>

<ul>
	<li>this that ain&#39;t-had-no-dad rap :o

		<ul>
			<li>I don’t know how, but with all the lines from ritchie with a t, this is one of the most likable openers to a record I’ve heard in a while; it’s so effortlessly appealing and only half-braggadocious :)</li>
			<li>that hook is so damn good too :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that vocal sample interlaced into the beat of bad boys 3 is pretty good too; I didn’t catch as much as I did the first track, but that peggy reference with black ben carson is perfect c:</li>
	<li>all this money is pretty much the same; I didn’t catch all that flew by, and as a result I just thought it was pretty good

		<ul>
			<li>the hook is yet again amazing though, so I’ll give it that :)</li>
			<li>that ending to all this money :D idk even know what tf I’m saying</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“Ya what you know about a young n—a like this / What you know about a young neighbor like this / I did the second one for the white kid / ‘Cause I know you want to say it, but that ain’t right kid” bruhhhhh lol :D

		<ul>
			<li>s on ya chest is another great cut overall, and the horns making up that harmony on the track is amazing :)</li>
			<li>that outro :oooo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that hook on what’s goodie :O

		<ul>
			<li>in general—both from the instrumental and all the dense lyricism—that was one of the best tracks I’ve ever heard on a hip-hop album of this stature… I love it, and the ending is absolutely golden c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>nice little thematic shift into girl with the gold wrist- and that guitar sample that comes through right before that intense, driving bridge section :oo</li>
	<li>lovely, well-delivered interlude to split this tracklist; great stuff :)</li>
	<li>that dreamy atmosphere to start off all quiet on the west side :oo

		<ul>
			<li>really heartfelt, meaningful verse from ritchie with a t; I love the references to songs he’d rather hear than his own at the moment, and the clear messages about race, safety, and kindness ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that insane, shrill instrumental on eeny meeny miny moe :OO

		<ul>
			<li>both the reference to sambo, and the fact that the original nursery rhyme this track is based off of is… about catching ‘slaves’… powerful stuff on the track, and the grating instrumental serves it well :)</li>
			<li>that mf explosion towards the end :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>woah… stepa’s verse right into that ethereal hook from ritchie is amazing, I love that interplay and the way it comes through right as stepa seems at his hardest crossroads :o

		<ul>
			<li>vic mensa has another powerful verse; I haven’t heard much at all from him, but the way he translates perfectly on this cut is a testament to that level of connection…</li>
			<li>beautiful track, can’t say enough good stuff about it c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>back then is a pretty good penultimate cut- I think in a way it’s a slight departure from the stylings of the previous track, but the instrumental that it closes out with is tripped out enough to lead well to the next ^</li>
	<li>oh my god that instrumental that starts off look mama i did it :D

		<ul>
			<li>god damn ritchie’s verse… that me hard…</li>
			<li>stepa has a wondrous closing verse as well, and the way the instrumental builds and builds, feeling all-encompassing and powerful as all hell… it’s beautiful c:</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
