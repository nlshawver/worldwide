<h1>mini notes for beerbongs &amp; bentleys</h1>

<ul>
	<li>while it didn’t hit immediately, paranoid is honestly a pretty good album opener- it has a good amount of personality and quality production to back up post’s unique timbre and delivery… and it most importantly comes off as a genuine expression :)</li>
	<li>and while I don’t have a huge reaction to swae lee (on this track or in general), god this instrumental on spoil my night is actually pretty damn good- and while some of post’s lyrics can come off as a bit meaningless, that final set is perfectly expressive to close out the track :o</li>
	<li>rich &amp; sad is a bit of a conflicting track- it’s probably the most closely detailed, truly introspective track he may have ever made… so while I’m not huge about the instrumental all the time, god damn it’s both catchy exactly when it needs to be, and carves out an insane amount of personality for this LP to ride on for a good while :))</li>
	<li>but I guess it makes sense that zack &amp; codeine is the first not all that great track on the record; while it’s a catchy trap cut, the fact that it’s just about the eccentricity of post’s parties matching the hotel motif sets it up to be a bit of a meh track imo ^

		<ul>
			<li>the absolutely ridiculous theme and track name makes up for some of it tho lol c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my god I forgot about takin’ shots… it may or may not be better or worse than zack and codeine, but honestly—if the way this is progressing leads up the descent that I may remember later on, I can kinda understand the abrupt shift into these two tracks of hedonistic excess ^^

		<ul>
			<li>it’s setting itself up for a collapse of everything around him— but not until he reaches the peak</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while I may have had a viscerally negative reaction to the main two smash hits on his debut, god rockstar will forever be an insane track with that incessant bass-line riding behind post’s jittery, uniquely strained and screwed vocals :O

		<ul>
			<li>it’s almost ethereal in its aesthetic, while genuinely creepy by the time it fades out… what a track c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damnn I thought over now was a bit of a weird shift at first, before remembering how absolutely incredible that chorus is

		<ul>
			<li>I can only hope the clashing between breaking up with a materialistic girl—while being such a figurehead of a hedonistic, excessive lifestyle at the onset of this record—is resolved in a compelling way… but for now, I am content with the massive production of that chorus swell :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while psycho on its own is just a really appealing, understated cut towards the midpoint of the LP, damnn ty has one of the best verses on the whole record up to this point :D

		<ul>
			<li>I don’t think the track amounts to much, in a similar way to takin’ shots- it just might be executed a bit better in its careful articulation ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>better now is honestly a really good continuation, especially given the lyrical content of the chorus; it might amount to only a small dial shift in the emotion of the tracklist, but damn it stands well on its own :)</li>
	<li>but while it’s not a bad track on its own, ball for me amounts to so little in the tracklist (in part due to how unmemorable the instrumental can be I think), that I already don’t remember what it sounds like

		<ul>
			<li>nicki wasn’t bad at all though ngl ^</li>
			<li>it’s kind of unfortunate placement though, being at the start of this second half of the record; I know in general what’s coming, but it’s still just a worrying moment for a record that’s already struggling with overall tracklist cohesion</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn I don’t even care about what I just said anymore- that refrain on otherside sounds almost magical with post’s singing voice :OOO

		<ul>
			<li>this has an even greater weight behind both its messaging and instrumental than what I thought rich &amp; sad was; it’s a bit of a mix of everything on the record, leaning much more on the melancholic, almost desperate singing… what a fantastic deep cut c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and oh my god if stay isn’t legitimately the perfect follow-up to otherside :O

		<ul>
			<li>it might not be my outright favorite, but it’s a genuinely impressive back-to-back effort on a record full of greatest hits :)</li>
			<li>his voice is yet again so damn expressive without being particularly overbearing- and that guitar work :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that intense instrumental behind blame it on me :oo

		<ul>
			<li>while some of the merit behind his crooning has worn off a bit by this point, it’s still not a bad track at all; the emotion is still present, and the production value is still as high as possible ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly… the instrumental behind same bitches does not save it for me- it just adds to the disjointed emotional value of the record, not actually delving deeper or more expressively into the real, genuine-sounding proclamations of previous tracks—

		<ul>
			<li>it just sounds like he’s delving downwards into the same shit that had him singing his brains out on the three prior tracks; while this doesn’t take all the weight out from under those great cuts, it’s certainly a bit of a disappointment to go right into possibly the worst track on the album ;c</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and then a mediocre interlude about something genuinely confusing to include in the mix of this record :/</li>
	<li>right before one of the better tracks too? I’m honestly just confused with how this record was constructed, but whatever; 92 explorer’s instrumental is unique in a sea of relatively imaginative beats, and the actual lyrical content (among the pretty good flow) is pretty damn good to preview the penultimate track :)

		<ul>
			<li>like this is the kind of track that I think highlights this very obviously conflicting lifestyle well- it’s a song about pimping out a mf $1700 car, and I love that, instead of the bordering on brainless spending of some other cuts (specifically those that fall after the conflicts he faces in relation to it)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while candy paint is a bit of a mindless track, repeating a lot of what was already said on 92 explorer… I can’t lie, it’s pretty catchy, even if it’s obv pandering</li>
	<li>bruh the mf fantano reference on sugar wraith lol

		<ul>
			<li>unfortunately, while I think this is a pretty good track, and might be the second best of the car themed cuts… I honestly just don’t care anymore</li>
			<li>I don’t care that he’s gloating at this point, it’s a staple- it’s the fact that I know there’s not going to be anything more of note to be said, and this is how it’s ending</li>
			<li>it’s a non-closer trying to pose as the album closer, and it just stinks of arranging the record for stream success instead of fully genuine expressions of what he’s really experiencing and what he’d really want to show off and explore :c</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
