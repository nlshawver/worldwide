<h1>mini notes for the money store</h1>

<ul>
	<li>get got is the only track I know prior to listening to this all the way through, and what a mf intro track :O

		<ul>
			<li>that sample is absolutely insane in the way they applied it, and even though it’s such a wild, unique track, it’s still effortlessly catchy :D</li>
			<li>and the fact that this is about so many intricate topics masqueraded as an imaginary police chase is just… so damn impressive :ooo</li>
			<li>fantastic starter ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit… the fever (aye aye) is already an incredibly detailed, insanely strange track, but knowing that the vocal lines are describing someone’s life being destroyed by drugs, along w the mental illnesses he has to wrestle with, is genuinely incredible :O</li>
	<li>that mf bass-line right after on lost boys is another shocking path to take; the lyrics are honestly barely audible sometimes, but when they come through as chants for the pariahs among us… it’s pretty damn good despite that inaudibility ^^</li>
	<li>blackjack is kinda similar- the comparisons lyrically, and the incessant bass enveloping everything around it, are all insane

		<ul>
			<li>it’s just anthologies speeding by at this point (on this first listen) :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that blur of money and murder on hustle bones is incessant as well; I might not be able to keep track of things, but at least I’m enjoying this minutely detailed, ridiculously frenzied LP :O</li>
	<li>while it’s almost as accessible as the intro track, i’ve seen footage is another depressing anthem declaring the things he’s experienced to be so out-there, so disturbing, and so detached from the rest of his world that he doesn’t even think of it as reality anymore…

		<ul>
			<li>I have never experienced anything close to that in my life, but my god the way he molds those emotions into the track is stunning in its articulate dive through those affairs :ooo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while the hook on double helix is nothing to write home about, that incessant instrumental and the detailed execution of the verses are genuinely really great in the context of this record :)

		<ul>
			<li>it’s also a slight respite, more so being a track describing and glorifying themselves, their experimental style, and everything that’s gone right for them musically ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my god that chorus after the first verse on system blower :OO

		<ul>
			<li>that unbroken amalgam of sound that persists throughout the track- and the way it explodes at times is placed effortlessly well, and just adds to how insane this track sounds</li>
			<li>genuinely this is one of the best instrumentals I may have ever heard on an experimental record like this :ooo</li>
			<li>the content of the track is a bit similar to double helix in its slight removal from those dark places as earlier, but it doesn’t lessen the punch of that track :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and then right after, to have parallels between inner city conflicts and feeling societally trapped (and also not having a care in the world about those societal norms and restrictions) is a great topic on the cage, and executed pretty damn well too

		<ul>
			<li>the instrumental might not be my favorite on the record, but it’s still insane behind the high, alien synth leads and ride screaming his brains out in the most intricately fervent way so far :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn- and while that instrumental is one of the most overblown and excitable soundscapes on the LP so far, I have a bit less of a visceral reaction to it at this point

		<ul>
			<li>in terms of anthemic forwardness and themes of violence, it hits every possible box and then some- it just starts strong and fizzles for me I guess ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>fuck that is kinda similar, just without the most incessant rhythms of the record; it’s not bad, and the tales of incredible violence don’t go unheeded (that shure hazmat line was genius) it just fell on slightly tired ears, and it didn’t lead to much weight on my end…

		<ul>
			<li>just hoping bitch please and hacker close it out well ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn the lyrics towards the end of the first verse sounded like ride’s normal voice lol (:

		<ul>
			<li>honestly pretty good track tying back to the confident themes of double helix; and that final instrumental was great too ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I don’t think I was sold on hacker, but the way the chorus bursts back in after that second verse of dense references was really damn good ^

		<ul>
			<li>that instrumental is a pretty good finisher too- I don’t know about best track, but damn it’s interesting at the very least :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
