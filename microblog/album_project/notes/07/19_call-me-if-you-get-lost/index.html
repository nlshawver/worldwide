<h1>mini notes for call me if you get lost</h1>

<ul>
	<li>nice little intro w sir baudelaire, but god corso is such a great full start to this tracklist :D

		<ul>
			<li>&quot;B-Hop, uh, French Waltz, uh&quot; god that&#39;s just delivered perfectly c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>these transitions and those mf horns on lemonhead :OO

		<ul>
			<li>42 dugg brings a great performance too; just the combo of him and tyler is amazing enough :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>THESE TRANSITIONS :D wusyaname is a treasure

		<ul>
			<li>yb really is better here ;)</li>
			<li>ty in the background is kinda nice too, for sure c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>everything about this record is just incessantly catchy and produced masterfully; the gravediggaz sample on lumberjack is amazing, and it goes without saying that tyler&#39;s more abrasive style combined with his more mature voice is a great pairing on this record :)

		<ul>
			<li>also thank u dj drama c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the french vanilla ice cream :o

		<ul>
			<li>the ending to tyler&#39;s verse is perfect too, damn :D</li>
			<li>the new wayne comeback is impressive as all hell, and this verse is one of his best performances ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit... that change and that expansively detailed first verse (especially, but it&#39;s both verses) on massa are absolutely incredible; just in awe at how well the messages come across and how great that shift goes in the midst of this dense tracklist :o</li>
	<li>and while it&#39;s a much more loose form track, runitup is still a touching moment; especially w tyler&#39;s affirmations, thoughts, and a vv personable verse :)</li>
	<li>oh fuck yea, manifesto&#39;s bass when domo comes in :D

		<ul>
			<li>this trio of massa, runitup, and manifesto are a well-organized statement, and kudos for executing it so damn well c:</li>
			<li>I agree ^^</li>
			<li>damn gina</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>uhhh go to the bridge thing :)

		<ul>
			<li>alright, sweet was a loving track in this mix of heavy-handed instrumentals- but god that beat switch and the air horn that started off i thought you wanted to dance is such an earworm :D</li>
			<li>damn... I don&#39;t think I had as strong a reaction to that whole experience as expected, but that ending was rly beautiful regardless c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn he love his mom don&#39;t he :))

		<ul>
			<li>SHUT YO ASS UP</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>unfortunately didn&#39;t get a lot from rise! either; it&#39;s definitely a nice cut in the mix, just not too shocking/interesting or anything like that</li>
	<li>his skin glowin :)</li>
	<li>holy shit that beat on juggernaut :OO

		<ul>
			<li>&quot;Got a E and B on the back of the seat / See I&#39;m done with 12, got a V16&quot; DAMN uzi :ooo</li>
			<li>this is a certified banger; typical great tyler performance, shockingly great uzi feature, and pharrell is magic as always :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damnn; that unrequited, first-take love on wilshire is both really touching and increasingly impressive as the track keeps going :oo

		<ul>
			<li>yea just incredible, fantastic penultimate cut</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and safari is a nice hair raiser to close it out; itâ€™s like an extended outro, and it sticks the landing really damn well :)</li>
</ul>
