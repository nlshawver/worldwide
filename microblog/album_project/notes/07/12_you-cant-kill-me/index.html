<h1>mini notes for you can’t kill me</h1>

<ul>
	<li>damn, beautiful sounding opener to open this LP, and to end off web :)</li>
	<li>while invited is kind of just sitting there for a while, and the build-up is good but a little too dragged out, when those unique drum patches and the rest of the instrumental come in, it’s a really neat experience c:

		<ul>
			<li>it’s just a shame that it lasts for less than the final half of the track, and just fizzles out- it would’ve been cool to see it develop even further I think ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh I already love history; that driving drum beat behind those spearing synth harmonies behind shake’s voice :oo

		<ul>
			<li>it’s just overall a really great, expressive cut, with a fantastic switch-up into the ending, resulting in a great, personable verse to close out on :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that deep, rumbling bass line on medicine is a really compelling addition under those previous lines about being absorbed and entranced by someone serving as her ‘medicine’; it’s interesting in both concept and execution, and a nice follow-up to the previous explosion :)</li>
	<li>oh my god that beat &amp; key change on skin and bones :OO

		<ul>
			<li>that was genuinely like a mind-fuck moment, I’m just kinda blown away in the way that played out- it made a bit of the lyrical content carry more weight (especially that outro), and it was just a bit of a magical moment there :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn- and while it didn’t connect nearly as hard, blue velvet is a nice, thematic continuation of the previous track ^</li>
	<li>cocoon is a small bop though; I feel like that’s a lot of what’s here tbh, just small snippets of bombast, surrounded in most of these tracks by atmospheric, sometimes ethereal soundscapes on both sides

		<ul>
			<li>it’s an interesting experience, but one that I think may start to run thin soon…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>rather in-and-out listen on body, where I know it’s a pretty decent track, but it just kind of floats there before leaving unfortunately :/</li>
	<li>interesting choice on the guitar for wine &amp; spirits; I think the imagery is a bit more interesting than past tracks here, even if the whole experience just leaves me faded

		<ul>
			<li>it’s not a bad track in this style, and a pretty good way to lead off this final leg of the record;</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>come back home is an expansive track- and while I think at times it can hit a bit of a peak for this part of the record, it was another one that sort of lost its weight right after it had finished unfortunately…</li>
	<li>vibrations feels like a slightly over-simplistic cut to follow, but honestly it does nothing too bad- it just sort of meanders in the place it was left by the previous cut, and offers a pretty compelling instrumental on the hook

		<ul>
			<li>I may be over-critical at times, because honestly that first half of the record was pretty good, and from what I’ve heard this second half has just been connective tissue to that experience ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>purple walls was honestly pretty good too- it was nothing monumental, but in the space it occupies it did a pretty good job at conveying a sort of ethereal quality (even if just for a moment)</li>
	<li>stay was a fine follow-up… I’m sorry, I’m just running out of ways to describe this album tbh :c</li>
	<li>beautiful closer though, I have to be honest; from that driving rhythm mix, to the alluring vocal performance, and the horns to close it all out… yea that was pretty special ngl :)</li>
</ul>
