<h1>mini notes for selected ambient works 85-92</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I had a semi-good idea of how this record would sound, but the introduction of xtal genuinely does feel otherworldly; the vocal sample that creeps through at just the right moments compliments well each and every sound around it :)

		<ul>
			<li>it echoes beautifully, it’s just such a wondrous atmosphere c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>tha might be the longest, most repetitive song, but I can’t get over how fantastical it sounds in its atmosphere, for all of those nine minutes :o

		<ul>
			<li>this was made by a 14 year old… and it sounds like the best ambient electronic album ever made</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the little small explosion of pulsewidth is great too; this might be the least detailed of the three tracks so far, but it has such an infectious rhythm :)</li>
	<li>that deep bass kick and bass line on ageispolis :O

		<ul>
			<li>incredible stuff- it legitimately feels futuristic, even if it’s 30 goddamn years old :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>i is a touching little interlude; it feels not happy, but rather just content in its mode… nice small track to split things up, take a rest, and explode back with green calx :O</li>
	<li>that acid house/techno atmosphere on green calx is genuinely infectious as all hell; i genuinely split things perfectly, going from the ambient bliss of the first four tracks into the chaotic mess-making of this :D

		<ul>
			<li>and those electronic growls that come through in the later part of the track :ooo</li>
			<li>I am blown away…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>heliosphan was a great little follow-up; I don’t really know how to describe it, but it felt like a slightly more relaxed version/follow-up to green calx

		<ul>
			<li>in general just another fantastic track :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>we are the music makers is a bit of a weird, understated cut; it fits into the mold of the record perfectly, and the vocal sample is almost jarring, being the first intelligible speech on the entire record

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a perfect mix between the atmospheric sounds of the first four tracks and the explosion of sound on the prior two ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>schottkey 7th path’s repeated melody is another soundscape that I love; it’s not too overstated, and it mixes really nicely with each and every sound that comes around it

		<ul>
			<li>the tracklist might be edging towards being a bit too long, but the music that’s present on these cuts is certainly not disappointing by any definition ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ptolemy’s more incessant, excitable rhythm and bass line is an infectious turn to take; I love the playfulness of it all, especially the way it closes out :)</li>
	<li>I do like that constant, throbbing rhythm and bass kicks that come through on hedphelym; it might be the most whatever cut on the whole project, but in no way is it not up to the same quality standards elsewhere on the record</li>
	<li>delphium is kinda similar I feel; what is here is good stuff, but I can’t shake the feeling that this record would feel more cohesive, more well-built, and better as an album experience if it was a slightly shorter artistic expression…</li>
	<li>okay actium is a pretty damn good closer, I’ll be honest; it’s certainly not my favorite track here, or even in the second half of this monumental record… but it serves well as a closer :)</li>
</ul>
