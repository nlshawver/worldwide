<h1>mini notes for strictly business</h1>

<ul>
	<li>ooh I already love this instantly catchy instrumental on the title track and opener :D

		<ul>
			<li>“like the E-Double.. or the PMD / he drives a corvette, i drive a samurai suzuki” god I love erick sermon c:</li>
			<li>gotta love the classic three verses to let that instrumental ride ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while it didn’t reach the same level of instant bliss that the opener did, because i’m housin’ is a pretty good follow-up, and has a close level of catchy appeal ^</li>
	<li>alright alright, let the funk flow is another great cut though; that beastie boys hook is scratched really well, and just the overall energy level &amp; aesthetic of the track overall is great :)</li>
	<li>while I’m not a huge fan of that deep vocal instrumental riding throughout most of you gots to chill- these verses are genuinely really damn good, and that hook is executed well too c:

		<ul>
			<li>it’s just another classic cut in the mix, even if it’s not the best imo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay I already love that sample in it’s my thing :oo

		<ul>
			<li>these verses are yet again both instantly recognizable, catchy, and have some pretty good one liners and quality moments throughout; this is definitely a personal favorite on the record :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>those samples on you’re a customer :O I am shook

		<ul>
			<li>and while the verses aren’t as instantly catchy as the previous cut I think, they still have a lot of character and personality c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly, the steve martin is just kinda there- it seems to blend in to this mix, and it’s not as memorable as most of what else is here unfortunately ^</li>
	<li>I do like that heavy synth on get off the bandwagon, and the half smooth, half gritty verses from both erick sermon and pmd; it’s certainly not my favorite, but it’s a good start to the end of this record :)</li>
	<li>damnn dj k la boss is genuinely incredible on his own instrumental track; would’ve loved to hear epmd ride over that heat, but leaving it instrumental was probably for the better :))</li>
	<li>jane is a pretty good closer too; not much to say in all honestly, I like the casual start and the way it just fades out successfully ^^</li>
</ul>
