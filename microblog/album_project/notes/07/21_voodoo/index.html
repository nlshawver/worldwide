<h1>mini notes for voodoo</h1>

<ul>
	<li>this instrumental, that slowly keeps pulling back the curtain on certain instruments is already compelling and interesting as all hell; I know what the best track is going to be already, but I need the affirmation that the build-up is worth it

		<ul>
			<li>those two verses are already great signs, the staggered delivery (and the very characteristic timbre from d&#39;angelo) is something that’s already likable in a confident sort of way :)</li>
			<li>questlove, dj premier, and q-tip are all national treasures c:</li>
			<li>that repeated outro of “play on, play on” is such a head-nodder; the smooth delivery (and just everything that surrounds it to make it feel like the perfect setting and atmosphere) is effortlessly engaging :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that introduction into devil’s pie is such a foggy setting to lead into; and my god everything about this track is hauntingly appealing

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a testament to its meaning the way it’s arranged :oo</li>
			<li>“Right or wrong, do or die / Only vengeance could pacify” damnn, I love a lot of the lyricism on this track, but that stuck out to me the most ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>was not expecting the only (listed/main) features here to be redman and method man, but especially the latter is incredible in the foreground of left &amp; right :)

		<ul>
			<li>honestly just a really great cut; it seems to not have as direct a core meaning as the previous two tracks, but a more general moment, laden in syrupy appeal c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and that transition into the line :oo

		<ul>
			<li>among the other fades between tracks too of course- but that was particularly good going from method man’s lyricism, right into this more laidback and personable style, filled with both risk aversion and intense attachment to that risk ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn, and again with these thematic ties to previous tracks; going from a track about literally holding the line of logic and reality, into a commending of love in general, but specifically for d’angelo’s newborn son… it’s intense—and even if the tracks feel similar, it’s an amazing connection that feels absolutely potent :D

		<ul>
			<li>beautiful ending right into chicken grease; i love you questlove :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the fact that chicken grease is in reference to (and in effect an ode to) both prince and george clinton fits perfectly; it’s yet again a fantastic neo soul anthem of unadulterated bliss c:</li>
	<li>god damn the theme of lost loves and past relationships on one mo’gin is perfect; genuinely one of the best cuts here so far, in a sea of gold :D

		<ul>
			<li>it’s just such a smooth experience, and the bait and switch outro is amazing too c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I don’t have to tell you that the path from requited love to feeling under a spell from your ex in this tracklist, now with the root, is a great connection; it’s amazing, and I love everything about it :))

		<ul>
			<li>that reversed guitar is also just stunning in this instrumental backdrop- such a nice touch to cap off the midsection of this ethereal yet cold track :oo</li>
			<li>and the extended chorus outro… damn c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god, both the horns and guitar-work on spanish joint are done and applied so well here; it might be the most transitionary track in the runtime of this record, but it serves its place well, and sounds amazing going through its crevasses c:

		<ul>
			<li>go on to the chorus again ;)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh that small, one-beat break in feel like makin’ love c: such a great moment to have sprinkled into this obviously sensual ballad :)

		<ul>
			<li>and while it does drag out a bit more than other tracks here… it gives you enough time…</li>
			<li>god it’s so mf appealing, can’t think of anything else rn (:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“Still long for happiness / Not promised to the plenty” god that end to the first verse of greatdayndamornin’ is just fantastic :D

		<ul>
			<li>this mf instrumental is so good; the way it sometimes blends, sometimes shifts around d’angelo’s voice is amazing, and the small complexity of it balances and mellows it out well :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>booty is a nice end to that medley :)</li>
	<li>still wasn’t prepared for it… already tearing up after the journey this record has already been—</li>
	<li>…give me a second…</li>
	<li>yea I teared up, and felt shivers each and every time d’angelo’s voice rocketed through, demanding to be cherished for its pure frenzy of enchantment and yearning

		<ul>
			<li>what a fucking song; one of few tracks that genuinely deserves more praise, despite already being loved for how expressive its fervor is…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while I wasn’t expecting to come away from that masterpiece into something better, africa truly is a fantastic closer as well; those rumbling, low bass hits, and the love now for an entire continent, culture, and state of mind is absolutely beautiful</li>
	<li>what an album</li>
</ul>
