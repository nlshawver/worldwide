<h1>mini notes for the life of pablo</h1>

<ul>
	<li>god damn this record starts off perfectly with ultralight beam :O

		<ul>
			<li>that choir, the vocal sample to start it off, the-dream, kelly price, kirk franklin, and ESPECIALLY chance the rapper… this is a perfect song, and I am floored each and every time I hear this magic c:</li>
			<li>jesus christ that that final refrain and outro- almost choked up hearing this for the first time in a while; “safe” and “war” are delivered so mf well :ooo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and then we go right into one of the most excitable and fucked up tracks on the whole record… father stretch my hands pt. 1 was and always will be one of the best hype songs I have ever heard :D

		<ul>
			<li>that line has grown on me tho, can’t lie c:</li>
			<li>kid cudi on that chorus is perfect yet again; those two tracks alone are one of the best album openers ever :)))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay I have to be honest though… pt. 2’s not that great; the sped up “i just want to feel liberated” is the worst moment, and the desiigner section isn’t good until he speeds up on the third verse

		<ul>
			<li>but we cannot ignore that it’s just a small weak moment in between two fucking incredible tracks</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>famous was one of those tracks that I thought was overrated and overblown for the longest time… but god damn hearing that beat and the way kanye rides over it is absolutely fucking jaw-dropping, it’s so damn slick :OO

		<ul>
			<li>rihanna is the mf perfect fit here too, that interpolation of nina simone is another absolutely beautiful moment on this already loaded LP c:</li>
			<li>“I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin&#39; / That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin’” that effortlessly cool start to the second verse is amazing :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I did have a good snooze, thank you c:

		<ul>
			<li>he is right though; and which pablo is he talking about :o</li>
			<li>feedback is absolutely ridiculous and crazed, even in the midst of this tirade he’s on right now; it’s a bit wacked out, but that’s the entire personality of this record so far ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while it’s just an interlude with only some uncredited, inspirational spoken word, it’s not a bad addition; it adds a good amount to the themes of this LP, and is a good overall part of this first half ^</li>
	<li>both thugger and el debarge make some surprisingly great additions to highlights honestly, even before ye has a relatively expansive verse :O

		<ul>
			<li>“Walkin&#39;, livin&#39;, breathin&#39; god, you know my past well” the way the beat comes in when that starts, oooh :))</li>
			<li>overall a pretty good cut; it’s not even close to the best, but it’s certainly a welcome addition in more than a few ways imo ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the drug-fueled trip of freestyle 4 is an interesting switch-up too, and something that again adds some needed spice to the record- even if it might be instrumentally the weakest since pt. 2</li>
	<li>i love kanye is kanye</li>
	<li>oh my god that instrumental on waves :O best moment of ethereal, jaw-dropping production since famous c:

		<ul>
			<li>so many mf emotions on this project and we’re only halfway through, my god :oo</li>
			<li>CUDI HUMMING :DD</li>
			<li>the conflicted back and forth of this record is honestly what completes these incredible instrumentals and the chaotic nature of it; even if it’s flawed as hell, those peaks are so damn beautiful</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and that conflict and tear he has among loved ones only gets exasperated on fml, damn :o

		<ul>
			<li>that beat switch into the outro was something else too; the weeknd does a great job on that hook, even if in the grand scheme of things I think this cut is just a really good follow-up to the previous track and its path on the record</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>real friends is that fantastic follow-up tho, and damn ty dolla $ign does really damn well as a feature too :)

		<ul>
			<li>it is a great introspective experience on the record after so much chaos, even if it took a bit to get acclimated to ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god damn that start to wolves is iconic as well :oo

		<ul>
			<li>the connection to kanye acting more “like a wolf” since his mother’s passing is a fantastic connection to make after a track like real friends; both vic mensa and sia make fantastic contributions, connecting their own experiences in this wild and almost terrible reliving of the past…</li>
			<li>I cannot get over that background vocal c:</li>
			<li>then connecting that same wolf like feeling to lambs and jesus being slaughtered by them; it’s a powerful connection to make, and one that goes really well imo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>thank u frank :)</li>
	<li>okay ngl I don’t mind the silver surfer intermission; it’s a bit of a faded moment, but the fact it’s from max b and he’s admitting his respect is something that feels genuine, and almost wholesome at this point of the record

		<ul>
			<li>it’s like a small turning point in this wave :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>jesus christ that arthur russell sample :OO one of the best uses of a sample I have ever heard, it’s so beautiful under these detailed, amazing verses from ye :)

		<ul>
			<li>the point of view of his current relationship, talking about a past relationship and the work he put into it is actually really interesting, and a perfect place to have a moment like this before the crumbling down of celebrity lifestyles on the following track</li>
			<li>while I am sorta peeved that 3k didn’t get anything, his voice just saying 30 hours over and over is all I need c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and then we get this mf masterpiece of lyrical work from kenny and ye :D

		<ul>
			<li>even though freddie did it really damn well, it is really hard to beat this rendition and the way it fits into this tracklist ^^</li>
			<li>I was in the grape van</li>
			<li>I literally don’t have enough good things to say about this song, every single bar is amazing, and it works together so mf well; it’s such an expansive set of stories with so many minute details driving by at a hundred miles an hour c:</li>
			<li>three stacks really do be preaching to the choir tho</li>
			<li>that larry graham sample too :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay honestly facts is a weird track to have right after no more parties in la, but to be fair it is the exact thing that would happen in this tracklist regardless; going from a denunciation and experience with celebrity life, right into the excesses and riches that comes from it… yea it fits pretty well, even if it genuinely might be my least favorite track</li>
	<li>damn okay that bass line on fade just saved it all for me; too good :)

		<ul>
			<li>and that outro with the way the instrumental shifts around the double vocal sample :oo</li>
			<li>honestly the thematic choice of going right back into the fading love of a past relationship is a fitting one; it’s a chaotic mess, but that’s exactly what the last two tracks (and the whole record) have led up to ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I wonder what saint pablo is about—

		<ul>
			<li>“The ultimate Gemini has survived / I wasn&#39;t supposed to make it past 25”</li>
			<li>“Real family stick together and see through the mirage / The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality”</li>
			<li>“I know, I know He got a plan, I know I&#39;m on Your beams / One set of footsteps, You was carryin&#39; me”</li>
			<li>“I&#39;m wishin&#39; that you saw my scars, man / I’m wishin&#39; that you came down here and stood by me”</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>perfect ending too, just as it started</li>
</ul>
