<h1>mini notes for shrines</h1>

<ul>
	<li>wow, didn’t think I’d like that mix of billy woods and elucid that much, but I guess that hook from pink siifu and the production from earl helps a lot :)

		<ul>
			<li>just two really good verses from each, and an almost atmospheric experience to start off with ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that q*bert line on solarium :)

		<ul>
			<li>almost busdriver-type verse from elucid, nice short track overall c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>this beat on charms is one of the most jittery, chaotic things I have ever heard, and I hear veteran a little over a week ago :o

		<ul>
			<li>damn, both that keiyaa feature and the audre lorde sample to close it out made charms one of the best tracks here so far; great stuff :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>pommelhorse also had a pretty good, commanding instrumental behind it, and the verses had some really good moments overall too; not much I can say, all I can think about is that tiger ending c:</li>
	<li>that transition into leopards was really good too :)

		<ul>
			<li>honestly just a really compelling instrumental riding around those hi-hats :o and some great verses too c:</li>
			<li>might’ve been the most complex peggy diss ever; honestly hats off, I think that was executed really well (and I’m saying that mainly bc I know they’re not beefing anymore)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly just in awe at king tubby, my god :O

		<ul>
			<li>definitely the most expansive and compelling track here, with a more subtle, slightly off-kilter beat to ride under these incredible verses; “your mind the greatest weapon, but your heart the biggest target” damn…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>frida is a frilled, creeping track to have right after though; that intro and the feature from fielded complete that atmosphere perfectly, but it’s still just such a weird, interesting turn ^^

		<ul>
			<li>damn, I love that nas interpolation “coulda struck the lotto” always love hearing that :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>interesting marshawn lynch sample, and same goes even more with that odalipo diya sample :o

		<ul>
			<li>while I wasn’t blown away necessarily by slew foot, it’s still a relatively compelling moment- especially with those samples bookending bill woods’ verse ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>war stories is a really good follow-up to that last track though I think; the beat is definitely not my favorite here, but especially that ending elucid verse is expressive and filled with some quality imagery too :o</li>
	<li>wow, turns out flavor flav is really good (:

		<ul>
			<li>okay but honestly, since king tubby, this might be my favorite track on this record with the way time works into the verses- and that beat feels like the most stable thing I’ve heard on this LP so far, great stuff c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and a very compelling follow-up with dead cars; always a fan of r.a.p. ferreira, even if his feature here feels almost cut short ;(</li>
	<li>ooh great transition into parables though, I have to say :o

		<ul>
			<li>I don’t think a ton of it stuck out to me, but a nice track here ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay while I wasn’t too sold on ramesses II, especially with how crushed the production sounds… yea that earl verse right into fielded’s singing over the instrumental dropping-out was pretty damn great c:

		<ul>
			<li>and a pretty good elucid verse to close out the penultimate, full closer track ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and a great beat switch-up and detailed verse from billy woods to close out the whole thing; it’s a scattered and confusing experience of a record, but a good one nonetheless :)</li>
</ul>
