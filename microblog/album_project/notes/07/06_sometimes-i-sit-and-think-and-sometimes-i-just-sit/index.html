<h1>mini notes for sometimes i sit and think, and sometimes i just sit</h1>

<ul>
	<li>what a likable start to this record; that pair of verses are so weird and laid perfectly over this effectual, incessant instrumental :)

		<ul>
			<li>that fourth verse is the best culmination of this track :D</li>
			<li>“i come up here for perception and clarity / i like to imagine i’m playing simcity” something about this slightly dark, almost uncomfy track is just so appealing to me, what a fantastic tone-setter c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damnn, was not expecting the immediate rockist explosion of pedestrian at best; what a driving, nostalgic plow of a track :oo

		<ul>
			<li>“what would freud have said?” the question of the century</li>
			<li>“dirty clothes, i suppose we all outgrow ourselves” that’s honestly a touching comment to almost close out that last verse on; great stuff in general on the second track too :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the bit of a quick cut to an illustration of loneliness (sleepless in new york) is a bit weird, but the guitar riff that floats in at the bridge suits it well ^

		<ul>
			<li>I really like the playful admiration of acknowledgement on the track though; it’s a bit of a loving but strained expression of longing and hope :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>outside of the curt transitions, this LP has been amazing so far in its interesting interpretations of rock and fusions with modern emotions- small poppies is a bit of a behemoth though, and I hope the runtime works itself well ^^

		<ul>
			<li>and while it can feel a bit lengthy and analogous to itself, the track is a really worthwhile journey- even if the topic of cutting others down for their success wears every so slightly thinly</li>
			<li>the runtime and added instrumental portion at the end are very useful, and add a great sense of weight to the track (and is a slight interlude in advance of depreston :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow… I love the inflection of barnett’s voice on depreston; it really adds to the aesthetic and overall atmosphere of the track, being something that feels distinct in itself while still functioning as a relaxing ballad for the conflicts of her life (and how they waver in weight so severely; coffee quality and mortality)

		<ul>
			<li>genuinely one of my favorite cuts on a record of supreme quality already- it’s just such a personal take, and the fusing of it all together is absolutely wonderful :D</li>
			<li>the fade out is executed very well too c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the simple topic and execution of aqua profunda!, while basic and incredibly surface-level, are so catchy, likable, and above all else actually applicable to those who have caught one’s eye… it’s a great little interlude in the mix :)</li>
	<li>dead fox is another run of similar instrumentation, but both the guitar work and topic at hand of big business, passing trucks, and roadkill are a great set of themes to have- it may be in a bit of a weird place after a love track, but the fact that it comes out of nowhere mirrors how those thoughts arise :o</li>
	<li>nobody really cares if you don’t go to the party is the perfect encapsulating of introverted tendencies, all over a surprisingly intense instrumental break towards the end :O

		<ul>
			<li>“i’d rather stay in bed with the rain over my head / than have to pick my brain up off of the floor” what a metaphor for idle, monotonous, useless chit-chat c:</li>
			<li>really good, exciting cut after dead fox; almost a sandwich, the bread being two cuts of introverted clashing desires ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>debbie downer is a slight enigma; I understand its placement especially after what occurred before it… it’s just the one track that slightly stood out as a bit of a rehash of something no longer new

		<ul>
			<li>not bad by any stretch, just the calm before the storm</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>what a heavy, penultimate epic to shatter the images of the prior introversion, and thus into climate destruction and existential terror :oo

		<ul>
			<li>those driving guitar leads that shriek like their lives depend on it, calling out as loudly as they are promptly cut off… what a fantastical, chilling experience :O</li>
			<li>that bass line to start it all off was ethereal and more creeping than anything else on this record, and set the stage perfectly for it all ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>then the descent right back to the personal lives- this record does mirror the experiences that have become all so normal to me and (I hope/assume) many others, constantly splitting interest and time and engagement between the tangible of your own life, and the existential nature of things out of your control

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a duality that’s worked really damn well into this record, and closes it off in a touchingly beautiful way c:</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
