<h1>mini notes for veteran</h1>

<ul>
	<li>what a fantastic opener for veteran; 1539 n. calvert rides the line between excessive kick drum and minimalism, and it’s just so incessantly catchy :D

		<ul>
			<li>that light, airy synth that rides between it all is a genuinely great touch too, it makes the track overall perfect- both as an opener and as a standalone cut :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>real nega is a wild, sometimes intentionally grating cut to follow- I both love and hate that sample he uses, cause it’s both powerful and emotive, despite being excessive and overbearing

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a conflicting track to say the least ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit that 1.6 reference :DD

		<ul>
			<li>the heavy experimentation and that cricket chirp effect is almost painful the way it sharply shoots right down my eardrums, but it’s still greatly likable and intriguing with the way it just keeps one-upping itself</li>
			<li>great cut, in love with how weird and wild this thing is so far :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>almost ghostly interlude the way it ended- interesting transition into baby i’m bleeding</li>
	<li>the fact that this track was originally called black kanye west is absolutely incredible :D

		<ul>
			<li>that was wild, and I loved the esoteric, off-the-wall references- even if the total impact of the track was (relatively) minimal</li>
			<li>has a lot of memorable one-liners and expressive verses though, loving that the style is only defined by the way it keeps changing :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>i don’t care :)</li>
	<li>honestly one of my more liked tracks outside of the chaotic, lovable opener, rock n roll is dead is another rough, raving experience filled with insane sound-weaving and intense references to peggy’s past, the alt-right, bloggers (uh oh)- and it comes off beautifully in the midst of this tracklist :))</li>
	<li>but even more beautiful is honestly bobbi rush’s contributions on the verses and hooks for dd form 214 :O

		<ul>
			<li>the tie-ins with peggy’s service, and the sample game :o it’s literally on another level the way he incorporates different sounds into each track, it’s incessantly impressive :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“my girl blonde like goten” bruh…

		<ul>
			<li>what the hell is germs though— it’s another love-hate thing, because it’s so different, so dumbed-down, so… damn good in the way it shifts effortlessly ^^</li>
			<li>peggy’s singing voice tho :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>libtard anthem, rise up c:</li>
	<li>panic emoji, or just 😱, is genuinely one of the most reflective, eye-opening tracks into the mental state and genuine human side of this eclectic record and the mastermind behind it… it’s an unraveling of sorts, especially with the fact that the instrumental is half the bathtub he was having a panic attack in while recording…</li>
	<li>the dj snitch bitch interlude is a great follow-up, in that it really isn’t; the instrumental rather than an attempt at a continuation to that cut is a great choice :)</li>
	<li>and then we get that intro to whole foods- amazing :)

		<ul>
			<li>then the rareware references as the closer :OO the way the whole thing transformed was really endearing, and made it another pretty damn good deep cut c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the laugh after the rick and morty reference ;)

		<ul>
			<li>and then the “Feminist, pistol whip your wife first, that&#39;s chivalry&quot; bruh… I mean…</li>
			<li>macaulay culkin is really good though c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>williamsburg is a bit weird- it might be a bit by-the-numbers, and the long runtime is actually a slight disservice, but it’s not bad at all the way it grows through most of its runtime :)

		<ul>
			<li>“put the hawkeyes on him, heard he like M*A*S*H” god damn no you didn’t :O</li>
			<li>I thought I recognized travis on this, damn good interpolation c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the descent at the end of williamsburg right into “i cannot fucking wait til morrissey dies” is just fucking awesome; the upbeat, happy synths—similar to the way 1539 n calvert incorporated them—is just everything :)

		<ul>
			<li>“got my reparations, here’s some jewelry” what a fantastic interlude, the inclusion of that inline with this chaotic piece is amazing :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>GOD DAMN rainbow six has some of the best vocal performances of the whole record the way yung midpack carries that lofi trap beat before peggy screams his way into the mix :OO

		<ul>
			<li>one of the best clear “full” tracks on the record; the way it descents into chaos and unbridled fervor under that creeping, dark rhythm section was amazing c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that name drop of kalief makes 1488; knowing what all went down, from lack of evidence of a minor theft offense leading to a 3yr sentence, solitary, and eventual suicide is absolutely harrowing

		<ul>
			<li>man of the people o7</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>what a closer with curb stomp- feels assaulting to the ears with that high-pitched whine, and the references to finish it out form the LP into a fantastic experience overall c:</li>
</ul>
