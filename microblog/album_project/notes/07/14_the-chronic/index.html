<h1>mini notes for the chronic</h1>

<ul>
	<li>classic introduction, damn c:

		<ul>
			<li>he really do be a penguin looking mf tho :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>fuck wit dre day is another classic, and a track whose reputation precedes it; I think the actual track is pretty damn good, but nowhere near the peak of this LP

		<ul>
			<li>it is only the first full track, so there’s plenty of space to grow ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn that sampled hook on let me ride :D

		<ul>
			<li>the connection between that parliament track, the slave spiritual it’s derived from, and the more modern connection to the ’92 south central riots… just a perfect inclusion</li>
			<li>and that second verse from dre is his best work on the record so far; effortlessly detailed and charismatic :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh that connection between with beirut on the following track, comparing the barrier between police and african-americans to the border wall between muslim and christian communities there… damn :oo

		<ul>
			<li>not as compelling an instrumental, but pretty good verses from all involved—and a very worthwhile track between the fantastic experience of let me ride, and then—</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god damn, the bliss from that snoop transition :DD

		<ul>
			<li>nuthin’ but a ‘g’ thang is easily the best g-funk song of all time, and one of the best hip-hop songs period; there’s almost too much charisma between dre and snoop, and that third and fourth verse split between the two is perfect…</li>
			<li>“is where it takes place, so when asked, your attention / mobbin&#39; like a motherfucker but I ain&#39;t lynchin’” that line starting dre’s final verse is delivered so god damn well, I always smile after that comes through :)))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damnn they predicted deez nuts, innovation at its finest :)

		<ul>
			<li>that daz verse is amazing with the small references, great stuff c:</li>
			<li>the genius segment on dre saying “protect these N-U-T’s” is amazing: “Dr. Dre’s testicles are very sensitive to injury and thus require an entourage to prevent damage to them.” lmao c:</li>
			<li>nate dogg on the outro is amazing too :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“If I have to die today, for this little African right here to have a future, I&#39;m a dead motherfucker!” powerful snippet to start with on lil’ ghetto boy, damn :o

		<ul>
			<li>I think a lot of the introspection dre does on his verse is really impactful too; snoop dogg has some good bookending skills with his verses, but overall it’s just a heavy, important track on this record ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the follow-up track is pretty good too, in a way a separation from the previous track, but a boastful experience against (presumably) eazy-e; I think it’s a decent track on the record, but overall still a good track ^</li>
	<li>and while rat-tat-tat-tat might just be a continuation of similar themes to the previous track, I think the hook is a bit more catchy, and conveys that hard nature of the record better overall- the ’64 impala reference was iconic :)</li>
	<li>that intro to lyrical gangbang after the… interesting skit track prior… is iconic as all hell :D

		<ul>
			<li>damnn that lady of rage verse is a surprising and amazing feature to have on the track :)</li>
			<li>same with kurupt and rbx; both provide great verses on this all features escapade in the tracklist c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while it’s a nice transition out of lyrical gangbang, high powered is a weak point only for its short length and the only okay verse from rbx; I will not speak on the skit that comes after :v</li>
	<li>damn that kurupt verse to start off stranded on death row c:

		<ul>
			<li>I hear that EPMD sample, gotta love the respect :))</li>
			<li>legitimately the only fault of stranded on death row is dre is only producing; each person on this beat provides a great performance, and the closer from snoop and bushwick bill is amazing :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oooh that instrumental and hook that comes through on the roach gave me that ooh face; such an amazing, penultimate track to have with another parliament interpolation :D</li>
	<li>the fact that the final track is called bitches ain’t shit and is literally only another diss at eazy-e is both excessive and the most dre thing ever; a slightly aged closer, but still a good track to close off on ^^

		<ul>
			<li>thank u dre and mr snoop eastwood :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
