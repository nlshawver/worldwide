<h1>mini notes for 6 feet deep</h1>

<ul>
	<li>ooh, that deep piano sample as the instrumental on constant elevation :oo

		<ul>
			<li>“critics say, ‘go to hell’, i go, “yeah / stupid motherfucker, i’m already here&quot; damn c:</li>
			<li>I was so caught off guard to hear rza here, didn’t realize until late yesterday he was part of gravediggaz :O and a great starting track overall, even if it sounds intentionally rickety and off-kilter :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god I kinda love that intimidation factor on nowhere to run, nowhere to hide; the way each verse feels more and more extreme over that instrumental is pretty damn good c:

		<ul>
			<li>the start of protect ya neck and then rza going “ha, sike!” is perfect :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the fact that these complex, staggered rhymes are all about different people getting high on different stuff is amazing, great personality; sorry I’m a bit out of it in describing these tracks, I am genuinely impressed by this so far ^</li>
	<li>that instrumental on 2 cups of blood :D I like the interplay between rza and poetic ^^

		<ul>
			<li>lumberjack has a great sample ;)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>blood brothers is a fantastic follow-up to that short interlude, and one that I think I love simply for the fact that it’s so detailed both in each of the verses, and the interplay between everyone about growing up in the slums and forming a deeper connection because of that :o

		<ul>
			<li>incredible lyricism too, and a great beat that rides under it all c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“BZZZZZT touched the third rail” ooh, great reference in this track about… well the song is called 1-800 suicide, so I think you can guess

		<ul>
			<li>just another really damn good cut after the interlude of 360 questions ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god damn, that jury scene and all of them admitting the lives they’ve lived up to that point on diary of a madman- just makes that horrorcore label come full circle with one of the hardest tracks on the whole record :O

		<ul>
			<li>damn good lyricism too, I love how staggered rza can sound, and how smooth shabazz, killah priest, and the gatekeeper are :)</li>
			<li>holy shit, nevermind: “This is about one man, with many different personas within him, created at birth, as society forces you to be who you are not. Whether by force, or by intention, he describes in this song the works of his mind. How we’re evil, yet we still strive in ourselves, meaning there is good there somewhere, as shown when he attempts to escape his mind, hell, evil. All of the different verses are him, speaking out and from their view. First, he tries to justify it all. Then, he explains what happened to make him the way he is, how we was put through torment and horror and how he wanted to escape that. On verse three, this is him when one of his personas possess him and encourage him to gloat and brag about himself, even though in the back of his mind he knew it didn’t have to be this way and he took the wrong path. The last verse is him completely taken over, there is no good left, he has given up fighting and comes to a realization this was him all along.”</li>
			<li>I did not give that song enough credit, that is wondrous and terrifying, and absolutely harrowing… genuinely amazing work on that cut :ooo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>great interlude to follow too c:</li>
	<li>it might be my least favorite track so far unfortunately, but bang your head is still something that sounds pretty good with that shrill instrumental overtop of the rumbling bass ^</li>
	<li>and while it just sort of comes and goes, here comes the gravediggaz is a pretty good cut, and one that in no way sounds out of place either ^^</li>
	<li>damnn okay, graveyard chamber is a more expressive, slight return-to-form (even if the record never really fell off at all); it’s just a much more compelling experience, and it gives a lot more personality than the previous two cuts :O

		<ul>
			<li>on top of the sometimes expansive rhyming, god damn c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the gatekeeper has an insane start on deathtrap; this might be the most accessible instrumental on the record, and I think each member shines on this kind of cut :))

		<ul>
			<li>while it still sounds as evil as ever, those horns in the instrumental just make everything sound more built-up, like it’s wearing a suit to the massacre c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while it’s not bad at all, the constantly staggered flow of the title track is just a bit too jarring for me :c

		<ul>
			<li>some good lyricism on the verses no doubt, but that hook just didn’t do much for me from the onset ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>nice little outro though, and a good way to close out this expansive, surprising experience of a record :O</li>
</ul>
