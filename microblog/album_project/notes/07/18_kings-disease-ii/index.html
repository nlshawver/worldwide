<h1>mini notes for king’s disease II</h1>

<ul>
	<li>damnn I was not expecting for the pressure to start off so well on this record; already a really great re-introduction to this (soon) trilogy ^

		<ul>
			<li>just a really good theme to start off the record, a pretty good addition from don toliver, and a great instrumental :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow… was not expecting such an expansive recounting and detailed storytelling on death row east—just a really impactful track about pac and the way nas and him were putting shit behind them right before his death :o</li>
	<li>and while I was initially a bit weirded out by the quick shift of 40 side, the end of that first verse is amazing :O

		<ul>
			<li>damn these first three tracks are incredible, I’m even more surprised by this than the original; this is amazing so far c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay I initially was dreading epmd 2- not because of nas and epmd, because that collaboration was honestly not too bad, it was mainly the eminem feature in 2021

		<ul>
			<li>but honestly… not bad, and a really good closer to his verse I think; definitely my least favorite song so far, but it’s not too far from what came before it</li>
			<li>that beat switch was also pretty slick :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damnn okay, the three distinct parts of rare turn it into a really interesting cut; the verses come through even better on this track than even some of the first three tracks, and that part II beat switch :ooo</li>
	<li>yea, yktv is the most okay track here; there’s nothing offensive about it, but it’s just kinda there, and it leaves no trace it was even here :/</li>
	<li>god damn hit-boy is a genius with this sample and production on store run :O

		<ul>
			<li>that second verse is absolutely perfect with the imagery and rockstar attitude; it’s such a confident yet charming segment of this tracklist :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and that slowdown and bit more introspective elements on moments :o

		<ul>
			<li>this is a fantastic end and start to the first and second halves of this record; I’m genuinely, constantly impressed by nas’s lyrical work and the way he connects everything together</li>
			<li>the words he’s saying usually aren’t hugely impactful on their own, but everything tied together in this bow (and that THIRD VERSE); all amazing, and a fantastic moment on this LP :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>alright alright, this really is gonna be an incredible experience in the second half isn’t it; nobody is already an amazing cut, and I’ve only heard the first verse, it’s such a great instrumental—and a great, atmospheric direction to take the LP in :)

		<ul>
			<li>“My dawg bought a plane, said &quot;Let&#39;s go to Paris&quot; / That&#39;s where baguettes are from, French bread that&#39;s long and narrow / I like the other definition, rectangular carats / The concept of this song is rather esoteric” hahaha the start of that second verse :D</li>
			<li>lauryn hill is a national treasure</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn charlie wilson :D

		<ul>
			<li>another great track with no phony love; that d’angelo name check on the second verse (and the verse as a whole) is great over that deep instrumental :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>brunch on sundays is absolutely amazing as a relaxing, more laidback track; the blxst feature came through even better than I knew it would too, my god c:

		<ul>
			<li>it’s just a happy mf song, and I love it, even if the impact of it in the tracklist is rather minimal (obv :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while it’s not the best track in this second half, count me in is still a great experience in the mix, and a nice re-assessment of life and the way things have been going :)

		<ul>
			<li>he really is fireworks tho</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn okay, hit-boy has a pretty damn good verse to start off composure :O that maya angelou reference is 10/10 ^^

		<ul>
			<li>yea composure is one of my outright favorites, even if a lot of the stuff here is in my favorites now :)</li>
			<li>thank u shaka senghor c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh that nasty bass line on my bible :oo

		<ul>
			<li>some of the best verses on the whole record on my bible, my god; this might genuinely be one of nas’s best ever… it’s so expansive, confident, reflective, and so damn well-produced :O</li>
			<li>beautiful song, and a fantastic penultimate experience on this record c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>nas is very good :)</li>
</ul>
