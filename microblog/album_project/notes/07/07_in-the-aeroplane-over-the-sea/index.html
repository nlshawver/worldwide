<h1>mini notes for in the aeroplane over the sea</h1>

<ul>
	<li>was not expecting this- I knew generally the kind of sound, but the specifics were not at all what I was expecting :o

		<ul>
			<li>“and from above you how I sank into your soul / into that secret place where no one dares to go” in general the lyrics are touchingly beautiful, and delve into burgeoning sexuality- but that two bar pair came off perfectly to me c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>those massive guitar riffs that follow part 2’s eccentricity in part 3 are wild and expressive- despite the mixing feeling a bit washed out

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a good pairing with mangum’s timbre, and the end fades and warbles out really damn well ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the message of leaving something important behind despite your death (in this case heavily based on anne frank) is a really compelling theme, and just has an iron grip in terms of control over the atmosphere and gentle catharsis on the record…

		<ul>
			<li>the title track really drew all that out, and I love it for that- it feels the most complete in the runtime so far with the multiple, heavy verses :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>two-headed boy is so incredibly dense; it’s the track that definitely made me realize there’s a ton to this record I’m just completely missing due to this being just a first listen

		<ul>
			<li>i.e., those desperate images of the boy and the girl connecting and being torn apart can both relate to anne frank and being torn from her love interest to the concentration camps, but also mangum’s feelings about neutral milk hotel’s success—and also the two-headed boy might be an allegory for music, in this case in the form of a cassette?</li>
			<li>it’s just so wild, I’m blown away by this track’s density :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the fool is a nice little interlude; the instrumental itself is great, and the not-so-hidden connections between this fool and the almost militaristic march of the song can both connect with either the foolishness of war, or the funeral procession of a hero (also didn’t know mangum was from new orleans; nice, and it fits more knowing that :)</li>
	<li>I love the explosion of character and genuine appreciation and respect shown on holland, 1945; it’s like the most lauded biography imaginable, and the instrumentation that revels around it all is luscious :D</li>
	<li>I honestly don’t know what to think about communist daughter- the raw emotion in its understated delivery is evident, and the sex-centered atmosphere is too

		<ul>
			<li>I’m just a bit lost in that element of it; most of my criticism for the campiness of this may simply just be a lack of full understanding or connection ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my god that chorus on oh comely :ooo

		<ul>
			<li>just in awe at that vocal performance…</li>
			<li>yea just completely speechless about oh comely, it’s such an expansive, wonderfully grandiose track :o</li>
			<li>holy shit is the right reaction, my god ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>those pulsating, garbled harmonies in the right ear at the start of ghost c:

		<ul>
			<li>have to appreciation the transitions on this record too, damn fantastic work there too ^</li>
			<li>honestly I don’t have much to say about ghost; I think it’s another in-between moment of similar yet loosely tied connecting wires, like king of carrot flowers was for the set-up of the record</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>another fantastic, even more opulent instrumental interlude for the record; [untitled] really was a great climax to experience before those warbling wind instruments come in on two-headed boy pt. 2 :o</li>
	<li>that last stanza… had me in a bit of trance w how it operated, and I love that lo-fi, walk-out-of-the-room closer

		<ul>
			<li>fantastic record, even if it didn’t connect with me in anywhere close to a transcendent way on first listen ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
