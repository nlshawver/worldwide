<h1>mini notes for mm…food</h1>

<ul>
	<li>damn, really nice start to this weird concept record with beef rapp, tying in beef and diss tracks into this theme of food :)

		<ul>
			<li>that second verse especially was really good ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that instrumental that starts hoe cakes… what is that

		<ul>
			<li>okay the drums and harmony help a bit but that sound is just gross</li>
			<li>honestly outside of how weird that beatboxing sounds, the track itself is pretty good; to me it might not be something to write home about yet, but that really specific comparison between the actual 19th century food hoecakes and—the very obvious connection by spelling the track “hoe cakes”—is really damn good :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>great transition into potholderz, that was executed perfectly :o

		<ul>
			<li>yea, and the inclusion of count bass d is really good too; the trading verses and the general aesthetic and themes both doom and count rap about are really appealing</li>
			<li>“barely born a virgin” is a powerful line, god damn :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damnn that sample of one beer :D

		<ul>
			<li>“they call the super when they need their back, uh, plumbing fixed” haha this track is filled with so many good one-liners, this was by far the funniest one tho :))</li>
			<li>that vocal is so incessantly catchy, this track overall is just such a well-produced marvel of esoteric references and wonderful rhymes c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while the transition into deep friend frenz is a bit harsh, the actual track is a confident-sounding, but lyrically dense analysis of how distance and friendships can intertwine and can sometimes drive people away- it’s a fantastic moment on the record, and is almost better than the almost perfect track that preceded it :ooo</li>
	<li>ooh fantastic interlude of poo-putt platter, with tons of little samples and skits to dot the amazing instrumental behind it :)</li>
	<li>fillet-o-rapper continues the interlude ‘section’ on the record, and while I kinda like bits and pieces, it’s definitely the weakest, and kinda just passes by without a memorable moment</li>
	<li>gumbo starts to wrap it up nicely though—and I like the ‘wrap’ / rap connection on the sample c:</li>
	<li>fig leaf bi-carbonate gives itself a bit more time to just chaotically unravel, with the samples present adding a lot of personality to an otherwise just rly good instrumental

		<ul>
			<li>I really liked this concept of just a block of interludes and beats, even if it didn’t amount to a lot of weight in the tracklist ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>kon karne was a pretty good return to doom’s voice and inflections; it might not be my favorite track, but it had a good amount of weight to its messaging and general rhyme schemes :)</li>
	<li>guinesses is a bit of a weird moment though; I really like both angelika and 4ize’s contributions (esp the former), but honestly there might just not be a ton of gravity behind the track? I don’t know how to describe it

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a really, really good track that’s just weighed down by its placement, since by now I’m looking for a bit of a pick-me-up, or something like it (? not sure tbh)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>kon queso is rly great too- the expansive, minutely detailed verse from doom is actually kinda wonderful in its phrasing and pure, unabashed display of skill

		<ul>
			<li>I think if I was more excitable rn that would’ve been one of my favorites :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yea this track is a classic :D I genuinely got a huge smile on my face when that strung sample came in- both mr. fantastik and doom are incessantly catchy while still riding on a (sort-of) abstract instrumental :)

		<ul>
			<li>god it’s just so mf good— it might be way more overplayed than one beer or deep friend frenz, but it doesn’t take away at all from how great the track is c:</li>
			<li>there’s so many great one-liners too, damnn; “so much heat you would’ve thought it was the middle east”</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>vomitspit is a nice little track to follow with- I don’t think it’s too standout, but that beat matches the amount of quality lines from doom, and it’s overall a good, penultimate deep cut</li>
	<li>while I wasn’t initially sold on the closer kookies, the fact that the instrumental feels so raw and excitable, the rhymes schemes and thematic connections that come through—between cookies, girls, and rapping overall—is just so damn good :))

		<ul>
			<li>“he don&#39;t mess with the ritz bits / wheat thins, saltines or triscuits / matzos or cheez-Its / catch sugar fits every time that he sees” another time he just effortlessly subverts the rhyme scheme… he doesn’t say anything else in that bar :D</li>
			<li>I heard that final sting :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
