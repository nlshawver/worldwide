<h1>mini notes for rtj4</h1>

<ul>
	<li>what a mf opener to this record; yankee and the brave has such a huge, all-encompassing instrumental behind it that’s genuinely distracted… but the bars creeping around it are incredible :O</li>
	<li>and while the hook is a bit goofy, ooh la la is a fantastic fusion of sound with greg nice &amp; dj premier providing their services well (in very different ways :)

		<ul>
			<li>that final verse from mike too :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god damn that beat on out of sight, executed perfectly with that shared verse, w/ some great one-liners and incredible messaging hidden within it :O

		<ul>
			<li>and damnn okay, 2 chainz is insane on his verse, he wraps it up in such a likable, instantly recognizable way- and I just love his inflection on the verse :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy calamafuck is the best possible written reaction to the song itself- the first part of the track is already an insane earworm with incredible lyricism BUT THAT MF BEAT SWITCH :OOOO

		<ul>
			<li>genuinely jaw-dropping, el-p is a genius with his expansive verse to start that second half; mike is equally hungry on his verse, and I seriously can’t dig up enough praise for this track</li>
			<li>it’s magical to me, it’s executed perfectly- z-kicks’s chorus is fucking incredible</li>
			<li>FIRE! AHHHHH THAT SHIT IS SO GOOD</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>goonies vs. e.t. is an amazing follow-up too; the focus on specifically environmental decay and the failure of our species to do meaningful change is a catastrophically intense focal point on the driving, intense instrumental behind both el-p and killer mike’s transcendent lyricism :oo

		<ul>
			<li>my god mike’s verse to close it out :O</li>
			<li>continuously impressed, I have no words…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“if even one scrap of what jesus taught connected, you’d feel different” god damn el :O

		<ul>
			<li>gangsta boo on this track is an amazing choice, she matches the energy level perfectly on that hook c:</li>
			<li>shivers at the “i can’t breathe” line; this was before floyd, and it still, still, still applies…</li>
			<li>“never forget in the story of jesus, the hero was killed by the state” there is not enough praise that can be levied the way of this record</li>
			<li>gangsta boo on the ending, I love it ;)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ju$t might only be the second best collab with de la rocha, but the inclusion of pharrell and that deep, murky beat behind it all is absolutely incredible w the dense, intricate lyricism (as usual)

		<ul>
			<li>“master of these politics, you swear that you got options / master of opinion ‘cause you vote with the white collar” god damn pharrell :O</li>
			<li>great closing verse from zack too (again, as usual)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>never look back is honestly a great moment after the politically charged messaging of… all of the record up to this point; it’s a bit more of an introspective, personal experience that has them reflecting on what got them to wear they are

		<ul>
			<li>and it’s a great experience to be taken along with, esp w/how genuinely crushing some of the lines are (especially from mike in his starting verse, my god)</li>
			<li>I also have to compliment how great these transitions are across the whole LP, damn c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the toussaint l’ouverture reference :ooo

		<ul>
			<li>the ground below might be one of the best deep cuts on the record; both the charging instrumental and the desperation for survival and greatness in mike’s and el-p’s verses respectively are awe-inspiring ^^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the more understated yet still enveloping beat on pulling the pin is incessantly fantastical- and el-p’s far-reaching beginning verse is unimaginably great… and mike’s isn’t far behind ^

		<ul>
			<li>both provide acutely specific and crushing criticisms of systematic issues with christian imagery, and it’s just such a deconstruction of all that makes the vitriol on this LP meaningful and so damn worthwhile—</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I have nothing better to say about a few words for the firing squad… it’s a legendary closer, and you just have to listen through it in context

		<ul>
			<li>“I need a husband more than the world need another martyr”</li>
			<li>“god blessed me to redeem her in my thoughts, words, and my actions”</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the fact that this album is cyclical is all the more terrifying, despite the theatrics closing it out in a heroic, western-inspired sort of way</li>
	<li>what a legendary protest album, and what a peak to RTJ’s discography…</li>
</ul>
