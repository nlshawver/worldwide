<h1>mini notes for odelay</h1>

<ul>
	<li>absolutely love that opening riff to start devil’s haircut, and the very stereotypical beck verses of half-jargon, half-intense cultural references; “heads are hanging from the garbage man trees” has very overt imagery of a lynching…

		<ul>
			<li>the drum sample is done really damn well too, and the fact the guitar is interpolated is really nice :)</li>
			<li>fantastic opener to this record c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that short (spanish) chorus into that overpowering electronic shredding- in the midst of a sample-based alt rock track on hotwax is such a wacked out combination, but is done so damn well :D

		<ul>
			<li>this is such an adventurous, but perfectly content record (and specifically track), being the right blend of alt rock platitudes but arranged in a compellingly chaotic way :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that harsh transition into lord only knows is almost an entire reset, and it’s kinda needed for how it’s verging on country rock—especially with the delivery of that chorus (which I actually really damn like, surprisingly :)</li>
	<li>god damn that drum beat and creeping guitar line on the new pollution is absolutely incredible; it’s not the craziest thing ever, but tied together with beck’s incessantly appealing lyrics, it’s executed in a way that’s impossible not to latch onto with immediate praise :D</li>
	<li>and wow; derelict always surprises me with how that deep sample saunters in each measure, demanding the perfect atmosphere for this lyrical odyssey yet again :oo

		<ul>
			<li>that hook is sung perfectly, my god… and the drum break that comes after, with that sitar following c:</li>
			<li>and the meaning of abandoning ship ties in greatly with the content of the track too :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>NOVACANE :D

		<ul>
			<li>every single element of the song is amazing- that repeated, shrill sample, the blown out vocals describing suicide gaits, trucks barreling down the highway, and people becoming numb to stimuli, and THOSE DRUMS :)))</li>
			<li>perfect track already, but the extended instrumental ride-out is just even more ear-crushing bliss; it doesn’t sound polished at all, but god damn if it doesn’t sound perfectly mixed in with this aesthetic, in the most quintessential beck way ever c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>jack-ass is another great experience to have in the tracklist; the more folk rock atmosphere is a perfect pallet-cleanser from the electronic, hip-hop influenced rampage of novacane’s outro, and the lyrical messaging fits it really well too :)

		<ul>
			<li>a personal favorite of mine even if it’s not too influential in the tracklist; that second verse is gold c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that rhodes synth to open where it’s at… :oo

		<ul>
			<li>even if that hook gets a bit older each year it passes, DAMN I love this track c:</li>
			<li>everything comes together here in the perfect way- the stylings of the mic feedback, the electronic explosion before he says “cheese,” and that bridge AGAIN :)</li>
			<li>it’s just such a wonderfully expansive track, spanning the stylings of so many genres; it encapsulates this record in a really concrete, likable way ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly, even if it might be the most grating sounding of anything so far (somehow), I really like minus; it’s a another example of esoteric story-telling that’s both incredible wacked out, but catchy and personable to whoever listens in ^</li>
	<li>and even if it started a bit weakly for me in its folk appeal, sissyneck turned into a pretty beautiful expression with the acoustic guitar ringing under it :)

		<ul>
			<li>“Cause everybody knows my name at the recreation center” is delivered perfectly on that final verse; ties together the half-casual style of everything really well c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the transition into readymade was smooth as hell- and even though I’ve complimented a lot of the lyrical content of this record, that first verse stands as one of the most direct messages of the whole record :oo

		<ul>
			<li>genuinely in love with that part, especially the final stanza: “And nobody knows where we been / Cancelled rations are running thin / Watches tick out of tune / Falling apart like a ready-made”</li>
			<li>the mouth harp is also a nice addition, and another very beck-like choice ;)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>jesus that distorted guitar over that very late-80’s hip-hop instrumental on high 5 (rock the catskills) is one of the weirdest combinations I have ever heard… but it still feels completely natural when beck comes screaming in on the chorus :D</li>
	<li>and the calmer, delicate guitar and singing work on ramshackle is beautiful; it’s such a great focal point to close out on, and a wonderful experience on its own as well :)

		<ul>
			<li>genius describing the hidden track as “[an] experimental loop that sounds like two washing machines having sex” is not what I needed to hear… but they’re honestly not wrong (:</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
