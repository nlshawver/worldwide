<h1>mini notes for konnichiwa</h1>

<ul>
	<li>alright alright, the self-titled intro is a slick delivery to lead into this record; it did kinda blow by quickly with the single lengthy verse, but the way it closes and the overall instrumental is pretty good :)</li>
	<li>pretty nice hook on lyrics too- it might have just felt like a continuation of the opening cut, but it’s still appealing as hell and the delivery on a lot of the verses (especially novelist’s) forms it all together well ^</li>
	<li>oooh that first verse from skepta on corn on the curb was pretty polished; it felt expansive, and the beat coming in strong at the halfway point was expected but still engaging ^^

		<ul>
			<li>honestly, even though some of the regional jargon can feel a bit weird to me as an outside listener, that was a really touching closer between skepta and chip; brings some much needed emotional weight outside of this grimy, heavy-handed instrumentation c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit- that drop on crime riddim was not expected at all, with how massive it sounds :D

		<ul>
			<li>ooh the way the instrumental shifts just a bit on the second verse is amazing, with that light synth plucking interweaved with the rumbling bass :oo</li>
			<li>that outro is a bit lingering, but kinda funny too tbh ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>it ain’t safe is an interesting track with a pretty good hook (representative of the 2011 riots) from bari; and while it didn’t hit the same high that crime riddim did, it’s still a compelling experience :)

		<ul>
			<li>“Bang brrrang dang dang, on my Lil B shit” oh my god lmao, best line I’ve heard on this record so far :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay ladies hit squad is genuinely the worst song I’ve heard here, and it’s not even really close; that hook both doesn’t fit in the context of the record, and it’s just a bit bloated with that instrumental… some small parts of the beat are kinda nice, like the synth stings, but it’s just way too overbearing and obnoxious :c</li>
	<li>thank god numbers comes back after it; it’s not nearly the most captivating track on the record, but it’s a great collaboration with pharrell

		<ul>
			<li>that instrumental expansion on the hook after skepta’s second verse :oo</li>
			<li>honestly just a really good single, and a personable message of wanting to talk to the kids rather than the press, and general distrust of label execs ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god that imposing instrumental drop on man is fantastic :O such a great instrumental to back up the rumbling bass on it, and some quality lyrical work as well :)

		<ul>
			<li>that outro bass :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while it doesn’t hit the same note in my head, shutdown is another pretty good track in the mix; less heavy instrumental with a bit more strained lyrical focus it seems ^

		<ul>
			<li>those drake parts are pretty off tho ngl &gt;&lt;</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“I’m still alive just like 2Pac” that’s not me is good simply because of that line lmao :D

		<ul>
			<li>and that simon line with the mf buzzer- that part’s a bit dumb to me, but the humo(u)r doesn’t go unnoticed :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>detox though, with that characteristic bass-line and some good features from three members of BBK, is pretty good too; the quality of the record is slightly stagnating, riding a line of good and just kinda there for me, but it’s still a positive experience :)</li>
	<li>and while part of me worries that some of the meaning of this record flew under the radar, text me back is honestly a really beautiful track, in a similar way to corn on the curb felt in its second half- it also helps that the instrumental was great from the start

		<ul>
			<li>the appreciation for the real ones, specifically the women in his life that care for him deeply (being both his mother and his partner), is genuinely really touching, and a fantastic closer to this record of heavy-hitting anthems of uk hip-hop c:</li>
			<li>that extended outro was pleasant too btw :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
