<h1>mini notes for funeral</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I was a bit unconfident in the start of this record, but that shimmering instrumental with the third verse regarding the decaying of those past ties and the relationships between your parents... what a beautiful starter to the record c:</li>
	<li>alright there&#39;s that weird instrumentation at the onset of neighborhood #2 :)

		<ul>
			<li>laika&#39;s definitely not my favorite track from AF, but the merit of the track outweighs the mediocre response from my own conscious; the final stanzas are great though, and it goes well into the next cut:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the overt connection to montrèal and that decidedly cluttered instrumental is wonderful on une année sans lumière; while in no way is it short, it feels like a great interlude in-between these cuts about very personal experiences, focusing a lot on the environments they occurred in :))</li>
	<li>oh my god, the start of neighborhood #3 (power out) right after that is absolutely incredible, masterfully done instrumental :D

		<ul>
			<li>damn the hook of the bridge is absolutely incredible, tying so tightly to these themes, commenting both on the deaths of friends, the pulling of the curtain on economic climates, and so much more :o</li>
			<li>maybe that&#39;s some applied meaning, but still...</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I like how justly so, after the track splitting up the neighborhoods in the tracklist—the one that begins to focus on environment—is what spurs these more general, wider themes of the next two tracks... this time on #4 (7 kettles) talking very obviously about the fact that no longer will these situations so dire change for the better, even in taking steps that would otherwise (and in the past) remedy these tragedies, this heartbreak... everything entirely

		<ul>
			<li>the track encapsulated that perfectly for me, even if it&#39;s not a track that stands perfectly on its own; the instrumental is a bit broken and rickety on purpose ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly, starting on the second half of this LP... I didn&#39;t get a ton from crown of love; the merit of the track isn&#39;t lost, as I see clearly the angle of falling love interest and heartbreak... but it seems only loosely connected to the previously occupied tracklist ^</li>
	<li>okay okay, that &quot;turn the summer into dust&quot; line, of not robbing kids of their lives going forward by hiding their mistakes, and thus never being adventurous in their lives— what a perfect way to initiate the instrumental peak of this track :O

		<ul>
			<li>genuinely, when the chorus of backing vocals came in, this felt like the right way to follow the previous cut- it might have been a mistake, or just misguided... but that&#39;s fine, and that&#39;s perfectly okay c:</li>
			<li>it&#39;s a lived experience, and no one is perfect</li>
			<li>that switched instrumental might have been a bit too sweet to the taste after the thematic buildup, but the vocals fit well :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and again, while the merit of haiti is something that fits well on the record, it just felt like a chop in the thematics; I can understand it well as an applied form of these themes, but it just didn&#39;t land perfectly for me I guess</li>
	<li>but to be fair, neither did the next cut either, in a similar way; while it feels tied well to the childhood naivety caused by parents, the vagueness of the lyrical content keeps it just a bit too muted to my ears ^^</li>
	<li>wow... régine chassagne&#39;s vocal performance here is really something to behold; while this instrumental isn&#39;t perfect, I think it aptly fits slightly uncomfortably into position behind these walls of being thrust into adult life at the death of your own mother...

		<ul>
			<li>while not a perfect record, and one I need that extra connection to feel tied to personally... this is one of the cuts that definitely got me closer to that point :o</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
