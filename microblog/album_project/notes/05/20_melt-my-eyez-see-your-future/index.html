<h1>mini notes for melt my eyez see your future</h1>

<ul>
	<li>alright alright, this huge “verse” of melt session #1 is already infectious; that vocal sample and the drums come together in a beautiful way behind zel’s incredibly smooth, effortlessly skilled flows :)

		<ul>
			<li>I love the fact that that’s all the track is- it doesn’t feel cramped or anything, it was perfect in the way it introduced the record ^</li>
			<li>that transition :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay and I can’t say I’ve closed myself off from this record before listening, because I’ve already (according to itunes) listened to walkin 34 times… but my god this may still stand as my favorite track of the year so far 

		<ul>
			<li>the verse of this first verse is absolutely incredible with the detail, right from the start with that de la soul reference, throwing their name across two different bars, split in half ^^</li>
			<li>but jesus christ, that beat switch into the second part with that break… GOD DAMN this track is absolutely perfect, and I cannot get over how wonderful zel’s verse and especially chorus(es) sounds, hitting right in line with this already incredible instrumental :D</li>
			<li>WHO THE FUCK SAID STOP THE TRACK</li>
			<li>perfect song, 5/5</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>worst comes to worst seems like a pretty good track to follow up with; the verse feels great in the way it comes after that intro, and the chorus is definitely a high point ^

		<ul>
			<li>damn, that second verse is the high point of this; the track itself is a bit short, but I think that’s a good thing</li>
			<li>the way it works in its space, and that wacked out backing instrumental at the end is fantastic :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay these transitions are amazing :)

		<ul>
			<li>that buzzy lee intro being bookended by gunshots is an incredibly overt, dark moment for this track :o</li>
			<li>damn… that verse zel spits in between his choruses is absolutely incredible; the referencing of recent events, his own live, the way he copes and realizes his fears… perfect for the track, and that instrumental is great underneath it all too ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I wasn’t initially into the last as much as the previous material on the record, and the instrumental feels just pretty good- but the connections made and the finishing lines of the second verse cemented the whole cut as a worthwhile moment for the LP, no doubt ^^

		<ul>
			<li>beautiful little outro too, the ambience and respite is definitely appreciated</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh alright, the almost interludal nature of a few of these cuts is really nice, and the verse here is a beautiful little connection to how zel would’ve been in the same influential music position despite anything in his life, the era he’s present in, whatever is thrown at him… great moment with the saul williams outro too :)</li>
	<li>let’s GO, troubles is a perfectly uplifting little moment, describing some of the most depressing, self-centered moments that leave you spinning out; the fantastic combination with t-pain and the FUCKING INCREDIBLE refrain by zel is such an earworm :D

		<ul>
			<li>it’s not the most influential track on the album I don’t think, but god damn it’s the best banger so far imo :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>alright alright, that instrumental you feel growing under 6lack’s chorus is a great opener to this track- and the way rico explodes on the first track is the best possible continuation from the exciting energy of the previous cut :)

		<ul>
			<li>damn, the best part is definitely the two verses from jid and zel, the way both of them flow through their places is amazing</li>
			<li>RUN THE JEWELS CAUSE I KILL A MIC ON ANY LP :OOOOOO</li>
			<li>lovely little posse cut, overall one of the better tracks so far too imo :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that mac -&gt; pac -&gt; biggie progression is a fantastic bar to start off with on x-wing, damn :o

		<ul>
			<li>the whole track and the playful intonation of his voice in the chorus (and for the content of the verses) culminates in another great banger with x-wing</li>
			<li>it might be again not modally or significantly distinct, but it’s a great moment yet again :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“I could either live like Jay or die like Jah / Alhamdulillah, let Jehovah judge me on my flaws” god damn, incredibly moment on angelz :O

		<ul>
			<li>this is the most significant track to me on this back end so far, absolutely hammering instrumental and some excellent passages from zel</li>
			<li>the karriem riggins feature is a lovely addition as well, great stuff :)</li>
			<li>gotta love the instrumental fade out and more atmospheric sounds to close it out :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the smell of death is a great little interlude too; that beat goes really damn well with that verse ^</li>
	<li>DAMN okay sanjuro has an incredible start, standing out in a great way after the previous interlude; the 454 feature is amazing in his chorus, and especially that first verse from denzel is such a smooth yet aggressive curve :))</li>
	<li>HOLY SHIT I never gave zatoichi the time of day, but in the context of this LP, the incredible verse and compressed-to-shit chorus from slowthai is stunning :D

		<ul>
			<li>literally every single part of this track feels absolutely perfect, and is another moment that elevates this record in a great way :)))</li>
			<li>it’s that huge explosion of character that gives even more meaning to everything that came since ain’t no way onwards c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>alright yup, with that great sample choice for the ills, and the introspective and incredible verses from zel, this ending to the record cemented this record as in the top two of the year for me so far… I don’t know which has more significance to me just yet, but it’s tied rn ;)</li>
</ul>
