<h1>mini notes for to pimp a butterfly</h1>

<ul>
	<li>every single time I listen to this opening track… I am absolutely blown away; ever single part is absolutely insane :OOO

		<ul>
			<li>thundercat’s bass, that intro sample, kendrick’s wild verse— god it’s such an earworm, and so magnificently intoned :oo</li>
			<li>seriously, kendrick, george clinton, thundercat, anna wise- it’s already a star-studded intro track, and every line is incredible in its purpose ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and god damn for free? is catchy as all hell :D

		<ul>
			<li>THIS DICK AIN’T FREE</li>
			<li>my god the rhymes on kendrick’s whole verse are so intricate and that ending in particular is so specific and esoteric :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>not even at the fourth track and the styles this record delves into are this wide; that constant bass-line under king kunta keeps this track lively, and kendrick’s verses and the introduction of that poem at the end are iconically powerful ^</li>
	<li>institutionalized is one of the better deep cuts here; bilal is an absolutely incredible addition to both this track and the following, snoop dogg is a nice feature, and the second verse connection from kendrick, relating institutionalization to his experience in compton is brilliant :o</li>
	<li>this fucking guy with this triple entendre; these walls is one of the best cuts in an already landmark album

		<ul>
			<li>bilal is absolutely incredible on that chorus, and its such an overall earworm to experience in detail :D</li>
			<li>thundercat again is a beauty to hear :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>jesus christ, u is such a gut-wrenching track, with “where was the influence you speak of?” really hitting home this incredibly fragile state of mind; it’s an entire state of mind shattering at the seams…

		<ul>
			<li>that aggressive panning before the beat switch, and what comes after— I’m genuinely shattered by this track</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit, alright right after is the biggest fucking 180 ever, my god :O

		<ul>
			<li>THAT’S PHARRELL? how tf I never knew that…</li>
			<li>this track is a classic, I don’t have to say how good, important, memorable, etc. this thing is :)</li>
			<li>the second verse is the most perfect rap verse I have ever fucking heard, my god :DDD</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I’ll be honest, this is the most emotional I’ve been from an album in a while :,)</li>
	<li>for sale? is probably the closest thing to a respite, which is both weird and completely understandable, given the whole track is about lucifer seducing kendrick / those around him

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a good metaphor in that way; it’s both a completely terrifying track, while still sounding casual and inviting ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that poem ending into momma is perfect, and damn that knxwledge production is doing wonders :D

		<ul>
			<li>I don’t have much to comment here, the endings and meaning behind each verse is incredible as always ^^</li>
			<li>it ends messily, but I think that’s intentional; the strained vocals don’t show non-intent</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>hood politics is such a wild experience of a track; that creeping beat under yet again some societally introspective verses from kendrick is stunning

		<ul>
			<li>I don’t really know how to describe the experience of this record, excuse the repetition</li>
			<li>“Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin’ / Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike’d be platinum” god damn :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yea I cannot say a single thing worth more than what takes place on how much a dollar cost; the isley feature and james fauntleroy on the choruses are incredible, but the only thing of note to say is that the meaning of this track is a worthwhile construction and destruction of ones own confidence in their societal place</li>
	<li>god rapsody has such a great feature on complexion; the self love that starts in identity is a touching moment on the track ^^</li>
	<li>damn the blacker the berry is always such a hugely impressive beat and track; the confidence and aggressive tone is so fucking incessant, it’s so hungry :ooo

		<ul>
			<li>that assassin feature for the chorus is so damn fitting too :O</li>
			<li>and oh my god the ending of that third verse is absolutely chilling; this whole experience though this specific moment on the track is definitely the highlight (so far) of this last stanza on the record ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>another highlight on the third verse of you ain’t gotta lie; such a powerful moment while still being wrapped in casual expertise :)</li>
	<li>GOD DAMN i is so fucking perfect for this record, I am never not completely engulfed in its confident, self-loving charisma that’s shown off in full—and the fact that even if its the ‘live’ version, it gets cut off from this crowd kendrick pleads with

		<ul>
			<li>such a powerful track and a powerful track before the final moment for the record</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?” god damn…</li>
	<li>the horns on mortal man are another absolutely perfect moment; under all these hugely important messages floats this ethereal, soft beat that leads you perfectly onward… beautiful moment right before this mf conversation</li>
	<li>—</li>
	<li>I have no words… the way that was spliced, the way it was put together, the poem, the commentary from both of them, and especially that final bowtie based around that story of the caterpillar and the butterfly with the rising action behind it… my god what a landmark experience of an LP…</li>
</ul>
