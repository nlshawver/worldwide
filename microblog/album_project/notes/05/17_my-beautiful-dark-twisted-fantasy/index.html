<h1>mini notes for my beautiful dark twisted fantasy</h1>

<ul>
	<li>jesus christ, dark fantasy is such an incredible opener; I might think that nicki minaj intro is weird, but those “can we get much higher?” spurts from justin vernon are incredible :O

		<ul>
			<li>the verses feel surprisingly detailed and subtle simultaneously, it’s just so damn good :))</li>
			<li>teyana taylor also does a really great job filling out the chorus :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay I love the cudi chorus, always a welcome addition, but while ye’s verses are dense with detail, it’ll always take me a second to get used to those super compressed vocals; the way the first verse ends is perfect though :O

		<ul>
			<li>that third verse my god, it’s the most provocative it gets, and the way the beat drops out and comes back with the snares for raekwon is perfect :D</li>
			<li>even though gorgeous is a sprawling moment on the record, it definitely grows as it goes; it’s a wonderful moment, and it leads into—</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>possibly the best rap single of the early 10’s, and absolutely incredible use of king crimson; the starting bars from ye are fucking perfect :OOO

		<ul>
			<li>power will and always will be absolutely perfect in its grandiose theatrics and incredibly robust instrumentals :D</li>
			<li>god this thing is just constant goosebumps; the snl and “colin powells austin powers” lines don’t mean shit when it comes to this level of maximal kingship; the way the third verse continues is just vulgar in the best way possible, but only right after he calls out mf obama… this track is just absolute art/pop rap perfection ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>great emotional, instrumental interlude… and all of the lights explodes really well; it feels absolutely massive in your ears (honestly sometimes to its own detriment), but with rihanna on the chorus, and the horns backing up ye’s verses and pre-chorus… this is still a classic :)

		<ul>
			<li>what the hell is elton john doing here :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I forgot how good justin vernon can be on this, his intro to monster is the best possible way to start it off

		<ul>
			<li>ye (and honestly jay-z too) has a great contribution to the track too of course, but…</li>
			<li>okay besides the cheesecake line, nicki’s verse is fucking incredible—that’s the first I’ve heard it all the way through, and jesus christ I got goosebumps and just laughed in how absolutely crushing the ending feels :OOOOOOO</li>
			<li>absolutely insane posse cut, worthy of the high praise ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>so appalled feels like a fair continuation; ye and jay’s verses are good again, but push just feels like a natural over this beat

		<ul>
			<li>cyhi is also great over this too, but I don’t have as much to go off of (since I don’t know him nearly as much as the other three)</li>
			<li>rza has a weird, short contribution, but it still feels natural as a half-closer (besides swizz beatz’s calmer refrain)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly I don’t know much of what to think of devil in a new dress; I like a lot of the bars in the verses, but not much else really catches my ear

		<ul>
			<li>it’s not a bad track, just the least-compelled I’ve been so far (outside of that guitar solo, that kinda surprised me)</li>
			<li>then rick ross just fuckin shows up like it didn’t sound like the end of the song, what is this man doing</li>
			<li>oh he dropped the best verse of the song, that’s what he did :O</li>
			<li>seriously that verse is magic for this track, just effortlessly extended it out to five and a half minutes, and in such an interesting way :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit, I forgot how runaway started… the way it starts with the piano, heavy drum beat and rick james’s “look at ya” going back and forth in your head… it’s shockingly well-put together :o

		<ul>
			<li>the first ye verse and proclamations come across really well, even if it’s for a lightning-in-a-bottle effect</li>
			<li>push brings some much needed difference and unique delivery to the track, and I’m glad ye follows with a sung verse and the pre-chorus comes not long after ^</li>
			<li>I don’t think the chorus is perfect at all, but I do like the sentiment of it especially; the outro feels like a bygone, touching conclusion to come after</li>
			<li>the vocoder is doing absolute wonders for the aesthetic of this track, and the way ye was perceived at this time, his message never reaching ears as coherent statements of value</li>
			<li>it drags on for a bit, but it’s a worthy break (even if you can’t hear at all)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay honestly… hell of a life has an insane bass line through it, but the lyrics that come after the first chorus, and the general energy of the track doesn’t carry very well past the two minute mark for me

		<ul>
			<li>the noise that comes after the chorus is an earworm though, it’s a really good addition ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>alright alright, I do like a lot of the beginning half of blame game; the john legend start is mesmerizing, and the sprawling second verse from ye has some great peaks

		<ul>
			<li>that chloe mitchell poem is a great addition too honestly :o</li>
			<li>okay wtf; I can sort of understand the point of the voicemail, but jesus christ this chris rock outro is painful &gt;.&lt;</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my god, this is pop rap perfection on lost in the world; it doesn’t feel transcendent, especially w the plain meaning of ye’s first verse, but it’s a fantastic earworm :o</li>
	<li>and the addition of gil scott-heron’s vocal passage is definitely a great closer; it might be a bit curt, but it’s certainly a fantastic finisher in that it’s a cohesive, distinct message, tying everything together nicely ^</li>
</ul>
