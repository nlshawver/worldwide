<h1>mini notes for ramona park broke my heart</h1>

<ul>
	<li>nice intro on the beach, definitely a great introduction to this sound and the way aye! (free the homies) starts off as a full track :)</li>
	<li>damn okay, dj quik is that early track that surprised me with the production; that first verse feels fantastic too :))</li>
	<li>honesty I wasn’t latching onto magic at all for a while, but by the final verse and chorus… it’s not bad at all; the mustard outro is a nice sentiment, and the overall track felt much more meaningful once I actually connected w it</li>
	<li>ooh damn, nameless is a really good interlude, and the way it goes right into when sparks fly is a lovely moment on the record :D

		<ul>
			<li>the meaning behind it and the general instrumental (plus the beautiful chorus) makes when sparks fly absolutely beautiful; best track on the record so far, even if the start was pretty good too :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honesty east point prayer is good; nothing incredibly special to me, but a nice continuation in theme ^</li>
	<li>and nothing really came of slide at all, it’s just a weird little interlude to me; I like the continued theme and all but not much in terms of instrumental was intriguing</li>
	<li>ooh okay, both papercuts and lemonade have an explosive amount of value, the former with overt and great lyrical merit, and the latter with absolutely booming instrumentals behind two rly good verses :D

		<ul>
			<li>my only complaint is that ty is barely in the track lol</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honesty player ways is another pretty good track to follow; the beat might feel slightly underwhelming at first listen, but the lyrical content isn’t lacking, and the general aesthetic and addition of the outro make it pretty good overall :)</li>
	<li>mama’s boy has a similar type of energy to me; the meaning is shrouded in the slight wariness I hold towards elements of the instrumentation… even if that meaning is really worthwhile and deserves to be fleshed out even more than it already has

		<ul>
			<li>nice interpolation on the intro ;)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>bang that, on the other hand, feels just like a blank message; there’s not much to it, and not a ton of substance besides social minutia</li>
	<li>okay the pure interludes have been really good on this LP, and the spirit of monster kody doesn’t disappoint :o</li>
	<li>especially right into the following beat, which feels much more significant than expected (and how it would on it’s own); I think rose street encapsulates a good amount of the total record’s themes, even if it’s not my favorite track

		<ul>
			<li>it’s just a great moment after that interlude ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>beautiful closer though; I was a bit torn at the first chorus/refrain, but the thematic meaning of each of those repetitions cemented really well in between the verses

		<ul>
			<li>a flawed, yet still worthwhile, great and (mostly) introspective experience</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
