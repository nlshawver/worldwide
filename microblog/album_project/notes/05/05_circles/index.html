<h1>mini notes for circles</h1>

<ul>
	<li>while I won&#39;t be incredibly impressed by mac&#39;s voice specifically maybe- I do love the lyrics and the sultry, choked-up articulation to start this LP :)</li>
	<li>and I wasn&#39;t completely into complicated at first, but after that second verse it morphs and peaks with those little synth stings; great stuff :))

		<ul>
			<li>the final verse and chorus is rly lovely ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god FUCKING DAMN blue world ALWAYS goes hard; I will never not feel absolutely enveloped in those warped, skipping vocals in the background, and mac&#39;s lyrics and voice in general are so touching and endearing :DD</li>
	<li>good news is a beautifully intoned continuation; not nearly as over-powering to the senses, but with that chorus and the way it wonderfully peaks this aesthetic... it&#39;s fantastic in the way it carries itself

		<ul>
			<li>that third verse is absolutely incredible too :OO</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that intro to i can see is insane :oo

		<ul>
			<li>god that ethereal chorus is just so lovely :)</li>
			<li>the way the keys come in after that last chorus is ear candy too; it’s such a peaceful moment, and… it’s just so good :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit… was not expecting the start of everybody at all, that’s captivating as all hell :O

		<ul>
			<li>I don’t think a lot of the content of the verses are all that profound, but the chorus is nothing if not encapsulating of the pure message of this album ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>woods genuinely really comes into its own really well; the verse is a cohesive mess of feelings, and the way the chorus comes off as so simple and pure is absolutely lovely :)

		<ul>
			<li>might be my favorite, slightly down-tempo track on this record’s midsection so far :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“I made it, but I hate once I build it, I break it” damn… that line is powerful coming at this point in the album, the connection to swimming, and this point in his life…

		<ul>
			<li>god baro sura’s voice is infectiously touching and beautiful on this track; perfect addition :))</li>
			<li>absolutely wonderful, kinda playful verse from mac; god this record is such a bittersweet, incredible experience :,)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly that’s on me is just a simple little almost-ballad; it’s not incredible, but it serves the album well, especially after the combo hits of the past two tracks :)</li>
	<li>the stuttering vocal doesn’t do as much for me as blue world does, but this is a completely different track; the lyrical specifics are a different moment to be touching down on, and I think for the most part this track does its job nicely ^^</li>
	<li>surf is another beautiful ballad that marks the albums last stand in a beautiful fashion; all the verses coming from mac feel so subtle and endearingly personal, and the instrumental outro is a beautiful, important moment of rest :))</li>
	<li>jesus and what an ending- the fact that it ends on such an unstable note is so perfect for this record, and I can’t come away any different than somberly introspective :,)</li>
</ul>
