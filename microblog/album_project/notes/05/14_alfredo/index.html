<h1>mini notes for alfredo</h1>

<ul>
	<li>alright alright, that starting instrumental and the way it turns into the main beat is really good; freddie&#39;s verse is rly good too, but pretty much just a nice introduction for me at least ^</li>
	<li>holy shit that chorus on god is perfect is so mf smooth, damn :O

		<ul>
			<li>overall that track was just such a spritely kind of experience; the themes of the track were great over such a concise, interesting instrumental and earworm chorus :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>scottie beam was really impressive too, interweaving these personal—yet still braggadocious—stories from both gibbs and ross

		<ul>
			<li>I was more just intrigued by what freddie had in his verses, but the whole track is rly good ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>look at me is a really smooth interlude type of cut- that sample at the end is really nice, and the overall message and aesthetic of the track is a great moment :)</li>
	<li>okay okay, I like frank lucas, and benny&#39;s verse is rly damn good too— I just think it&#39;s an outtake sort of track, and not much came of it for me personally :/

		<ul>
			<li>the meaning and references of the track is its best selling point imo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the start and first verse of something to rap about was surprisingly good too... and I think by the start of tyler&#39;s verse I think I got the point of this record; it&#39;s not as harsh or powerfully intoned as piñata or bandana, it&#39;s more subtle and a slow-burner

		<ul>
			<li>and I appreciate that a lot, just maybe a bit too late for this first listen</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oooh baby $hit&#39;s beat is the best I&#39;ve heard so far; those fuzzy bass kicks are lovely :D

		<ul>
			<li>the verse is pretty good, but I love the almost playful nature of that chorus and the way it morphs quickly into the second verse :)</li>
			<li>holy shit what a sample at the end :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn, I absolutely love the themes and form that babies &amp; fools takes with that constant &#39;all of me&#39; refrain; this record has completely changed for me, and this track is absolutely lovely :O

		<ul>
			<li>that crisp beat and the conway feature are absolutely perfect for the track too, damn :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>skinny suge is almost another light interlude, but with the themes and the somber beat... it&#39;s anything but boring :o

		<ul>
			<li>great way to follow up babies &amp; fools, damn ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wtf :OO this dude rhymed &quot;namu myōhō renge kyō&quot; with &quot;my coca do the tina turner&quot; DAMN

		<ul>
			<li>all glass is a fantastic closer; it might be dusty and a bit grimy, but that&#39;s what makes it so damn compelling and interesting with its lyrics carrying the rest of the weight :O</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
