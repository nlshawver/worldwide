<h1>mini notes for no fear of time</h1>

<ul>
	<li>o.G. had a really nice starting verse from yasiin, but damn that sung chorus from him was actually incredible :D

		<ul>
			<li>talib&#39;s verse was pretty good too, but bey was the standout for sure ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay yasiin&#39;s verse again, especially over this crazed beat from madlib... it&#39;s amazing :)

		<ul>
			<li>that ezekiel pulp fiction bar is perfection :))</li>
			<li>ooh okay talib is mf great here too, woah :O</li>
			<li>&quot;Colder than the winter wind, day after december 10&quot; is a great callback, and the way his verse ends :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that third track is a lovely respite and a casual little break; but god I can&#39;t get over how beautiful yasiin&#39;s voice can be :D</li>
	<li>my favorite band is a nice little moment too; I think it fits in well thematically, just a bit short honestly</li>
	<li>i&#39;m not gonna lie in a saying that fifth track didn&#39;t do much more me at all; that &quot;ain&#39;t a product placement&quot; line just feels off given the rollout of this album...

		<ul>
			<li>it&#39;s not bad, justâ€” kinda disappointing honestly</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay yonders is a bit of a return; talib sounds really good in his verse, and especially the start of bey&#39;s verse was great too

		<ul>
			<li>that beat just sounds rly shrill to my ears ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>great transition to supreme alchemy :)</li>
	<li>damnn okay this beat is really mf good; and shit, that bar from talib: &quot;you&#39;ll always be the winner if you decide what the metric is&quot;

		<ul>
			<li>this all-talib track is rly damn good :))</li>
			<li>&quot;seen the same kind of fate that turned dumile to metal face&quot; GOD DAMN</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>freequency is definitely up there with the best tracks here; the beat complements black thought, talib, and bey equally well :))

		<ul>
			<li>each verse just feels detailed in its insight, yet still casually effortless in its quality ^</li>
			<li>again, the singing from yasiin is really getting me as the outro :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>no fear of time is a great ending, especially with that yummy bingham &amp; greg tate spoken ending; it&#39;s a great, spacey, chilled-out moment worthy of the true ending :)</li>
	<li>but I&#39;m still gonna listen to mineral mountain as the tenth track (:</li>
	<li>GOD DAMN that madlib beat is so mf crisp :DD

		<ul>
			<li>it&#39;s kind of a shame mineral mountain was just a one off single, I feel it could&#39;ve gone so well as part of the album experience ^</li>
			<li>but either way, it&#39;s by far the most raw and exciting track here, black thought is incredible as usual, and bey is just having the time of his life at the end there :))</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
