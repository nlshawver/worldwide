<h1>mini notes for damn.</h1>

<ul>
	<li>classic introduction, not much to say :o</li>
	<li>god dna. still goes SO FUCKING HARD with that initial beat drop and the SWITCH-UP :OOO

		<ul>
			<li>ear candy every single day :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yah. is still a bit of a weird continuation from such an aggressive starting track, but it still feels completely iconic for the album

		<ul>
			<li>not saying it&#39;s...great...just very fitting in the album and how it sounds ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>element. feels like what yah. is supposed to be honestly—I can understand both, but element. feels much more cohesive and vital to the album&#39;s structure (even if it&#39;s just pretty good)

		<ul>
			<li>those final bars and beat flip are really damn good tho :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>feel. is absolutely beautiful; the contrasting feelings and internal conflict are a great commentary to have in between these very specific, very concrete rhymes ^^

		<ul>
			<li>when kenny stretches out a bit and goes out of range of the &quot;i feel like&quot; rigid theme, that whole verse and those straggling bars that lead up into it are absolutely incredible :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay... while some moments of loyalty. are really good, like DAMN. that bass is earth shattering—but other than some of those moments in instrumental and lyrical earworms, this track is very, very specific to this record, and has most of its value in its &#39;vibe&#39; and aesthetic

		<ul>
			<li>I&#39;m saying I think it&#39;s just pretty good</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god damn and right into pride. ...this may be one of the best songs on the record with how effortlessly it floats on introspection from kendrick :ooo</li>
	<li>humble. is still a hit, and its unrelenting energy &amp; incredible beat is yet another earworm...but I think it may be aging worse and worse as fresh has turned to five years old...</li>
	<li>lust. is really great in the growth and wavy methodology of kendrick&#39;s rhymes, and it&#39;s one of the more interesting, compelling tracks here...

		<ul>
			<li>but god I&#39;ve experienced this before, but this high hat is genuinely so fucking annoying; it is constant, inordinately loud, and pierces my ears in a disgusting way that makes me uncomfortable every single time I listen to it</li>
			<li>whatever, it&#39;s still a good track</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>love. is not though; zacari is alright, kendrick is alright... it&#39;s all just alright for everyone involved</li>
	<li>xxx. is a really interesting track though; in terms of bangers, this is the third after dna. and humble. and my god if it&#39;s not the one that sucks you in the most compared to what&#39;s around it :O

		<ul>
			<li>that fuzzy beat and the deep intonation of kendrick&#39;s voice is incredible, and when he explodes... fucking hell :D</li>
			<li>&quot;ain&#39;t no black power when your baby killed by a coward&quot; jesus...</li>
			<li>the u2 feature is somehow pretty good; don&#39;t know he did it, but he did :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>fear. is a wild, introspective journey that deserves all of its appealing merit in self-reflection, even if that chorus isn&#39;t my favorite in absolute</li>
	<li>and... while it kinda fits... i&#39;m just confused with how out-of-place and upbeat-in-a-fake-way god. is, especially since it&#39;s not really about god, it&#39;s about how feelings of success influence kendrick

		<ul>
			<li>it&#39;s one of those topics much better served earlier in the record, and in a much different method of articulation imo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>duckworth. is an absolutely ethereal moment on the record; this sprawling story masquerading into the tale of how the very figure overseeing kendrick&#39;s label could&#39;ve killed his father... it&#39;s a crushing moment with an absolutely incredible sampled instrumental—and then you hear the whole experience reverse and restart, happening in your head all over again...</li>
</ul>
