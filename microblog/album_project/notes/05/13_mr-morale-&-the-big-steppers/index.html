<h1>mini notes for mr. morale &amp; the big steppers</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I literally have no idea what to expect, and I’m kinda thrilled :o</li>
	<li>god the harps that come in on the third verse and the way that drumbeat destroys the aesthetic in that first chorus is incredible; I like the loose strings of the verses tying it all together, and the wild instrumentation does wonders for the track I think ^^

		<ul>
			<li>beautiful piano to close on :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>DAMN that deep inflection of the first verse of N95 is insane :OO

		<ul>
			<li>that second verse is amazing too, and I love that distinctly keem-esque inflection and crazed manner on the chorus :))</li>
			<li>have to pay attention to that strained synth lead and the way it makes this track wildly different… only five minutes into the record :o</li>
			<li>the high-pitched vocals at that third verse aren’t my favorite, but with the way the track ends… god damn N95 is insane :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god kodak black is such a weird choice, but I’m definitely hopeful for how it goes over

		<ul>
			<li>and wow… I was doubtful of worldwide steppers, but the way that last verse ended is so damn powerful :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>again, a bit doubtful of the initial beat of die hard, but both blxst and amanda reifer did a fantastic job at the start and on the choruses in general ^

		<ul>
			<li>I feel like this is something I might not have liked on damn, but with the style of the last track and how different this album has been so far… especially with kendrick’s second appearance coming after, this is a nice, more positively intoned cut ^^</li>
			<li>yea the end of his second verse is another great quotable :O</li>
			<li>looking into it this cut is relating heavily to nipsey hussle, and if so that’s a great way to place it in the tracklist; it’s a great dedication and the features + instrumental are great :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>GOD DAMN that beat coming in on the verse of father time is absolutely insane :OOOO

		<ul>
			<li>it’s such a mf earworm, and that sampha chorus is rly good too; these verses feel like the peak of the personal narrative going into this record (with that starting spoken snippet being a great beginning)</li>
			<li>bruh that kanye bar :oo</li>
			<li>another fantastic ending of that sprawling, detailed verse; I feel it’s not a hugely impressive verse, but the character and meaning of it (along with the inflection) is plenty great :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit this interlude is genuinely really impressive, and this buildup is insane :O

		<ul>
			<li>god those blatant callouts to the public disparity between the two of them is really sincere; great stuff to me :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the mf brother bars lmao

		<ul>
			<li>damn… that thoughts &amp; prayers line was the best line of this track</li>
			<li>honestly I wasn’t that blown away by the track; it’s much more creeping and subtle than I was expecting, especially with the interlude build-up beforehand</li>
			<li>not bad at all, maybe just not what I was expecting ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“I do the same when we fucking” holy shit this track…

		<ul>
			<li>what the absolute fuck, there’s nothing I can say about that six minute cut</li>
			<li>what do you do after that? jesus christ there’s so much to unpack I have no idea what to even think</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the connection of tip-toeing from the end of we cry together to purple hearts is great, that’s a nice touch

		<ul>
			<li>still fucked up from that last track, but whatever O:</li>
			<li>that eat my ass bar just snapped me out of it, jesus christ lmao</li>
			<li>honestly summer walker’s part overall is pretty good, but… god damn the power behind ghostface and his scratchy inflection with those vocal lines is an absolutely lovely end to the first half of this double LP :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that first verse of count me out is absolutely beautiful, great vocals and the actual lyrics are lovely :)

		<ul>
			<li>the sporadic nature of this chorus - post-chorus - bridge - chorus is actually kinda nice; it’s a bit jarring, but in a perfect way for this track I think ^^</li>
			<li>that deep beat is a nice contrast to the high-pitch but not shrill intonation of kendrick’s bars :o</li>
			<li>great outro too c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>crown might be the slowest burner on the entire tracklist so far, and while its largely just an internal reflection that feels a bit isolating… the way it grows and ends with those incredibly shrill, screeching repetitions is lovely :o</li>
	<li>god that trap beat on silent hill is such a wild change-up :O

		<ul>
			<li>that chorus is not great to me… yet, ik I had the same feeling towards range brothers at first lol</li>
			<li>DUDE WHAT THE FUCK, kodak’s verse is actually insanely good, tf? interweaving the album’s themes with his own experiences was a sincere moment that I really f with :DD</li>
			<li>this was the most surprisingly great track so far ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that eckhart tolle sample to start the savior interlude is a great touch, especially going right into keem ^^

		<ul>
			<li>those strings are a beautiful instrumental to have under these detailed, sporadic vocal lines :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that first verse on savior is really damn good; the connection unseen with kodak, and the white mentality of ‘solidarity’ he describes is an interesting continuation of this track’s motifs and themes

		<ul>
			<li>this is definitely a track I’ll have to come back to; the meaning and sprawling nature of it is too much for one listen, but that first listen was impressive nonetheless</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow… auntie diaries is genuinely a touching tale and conversation; it ends in a very… blunt way, and I’ll keep it at that for now :o</li>
	<li>DAMN that instrumental and first verse on mr. morale is such an insane earworm; god it’s absolutely crushing :OO

		<ul>
			<li>sam dew and tanna leone both do an incredible job on the choruses and interludes ^^^</li>
			<li>but damn that second kendrick verse with that deep, rumbling bass is the catchiest, most harmonically intriguing part of this track :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>god, mother i sober is the most distinct, emotionally touching, and sincere way to show off these very traumatic, hugely crushing experiences in a family structure / history

		<ul>
			<li>and god beth gibbons is an absolute joy to have on the track; her comments at the end of the track are a direct, great way to close the curtains on these experiences ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that chorus on mirror is such a bittersweet explosion of compassionate emotion; this feels like that same sort of moment as i on tpab, being this culmination of all that came before

		<ul>
			<li>“Run away from the culture to follow my heart” …god, that vocal line right into the bridge is absolutely incredible, what a fantastic, grand ending to this record :O</li>
			<li>it cuts rather quickly, but that’s alright c:</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
