<h1>mini notes for run the jewels 2</h1>

<ul>
	<li>damn, absolutely crushing beginning to the record with jeopardy; both killer mike and el-p end with insane earworms for the end of their respective verses :o</li>
	<li>ooh okay… the first verse from mike cemented this track already as a huge hit, just with how effortless his flow forces into this high energy cut :D

		<ul>
			<li>god damn, and the set of mike to el back to mike as an ending was absolutely insane :O</li>
			<li>I have to mention that all of these bars are dense with deeper meaning, and I’m just looking at surface level rn :ooo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>DAMNNN blockbuster night pt. 1 has such an insane beat :O

		<ul>
			<li>jesus christ the point of this track matches up exactly with how insanely claustrophobic and fully encapsulating this instrumental is in the way it crunches your ears :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>dude, killer mike’s first verse on close your eyes… it’s just so damn infectious, I can’t get over this constantly fucking insane energy level :ooo

		<ul>
			<li>HELL YEAH de la rocha on this :D</li>
			<li>that bitches brew line was so satisfying, the shout-outs to the classics :))</li>
			<li>another great closer with his verse, incredible stuff ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the playful verse from mike on the start and those goldeneye silenced shots on his “pow pow pow” line is just… everything you’d ever need :)

		<ul>
			<li>okay while probably the ‘weakest’ or least influential track on the project so far, all my life is still really damn good, and it’s ending is still infectious as all hell ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the chorus on lie cheat steal elevated that track a lot, damn :o

		<ul>
			<li>holy shit and yet again killer mike’s verse is absolutely incredible, both with how infectiously catchy it is, and the way he sets up these themes of oppression, suffering, and governmental misdeeds; it’s crushing and it encapsulates the rage of the situation perfectly :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my god and early is a perfect continuation, delving into the personal side of the way injustice is seen and experienced; the story told from killer mike is a heart-wrenching moment, and hearing that boots chorus soar over this harsh instrumental is absolutely gutting and somehow ethereal :OO

		<ul>
			<li>el-p has a great contribution too, and the way it ends is absolutely incredible, but the main focus is definitely on how he responds and continues on from mike’s story ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I have to compliment the sound design and sound effects all over this record, it adds so much character and personality to the instrumental; the pac-man sound on early and the deep gun shots lacing the beat is amazing on all due respect :o</li>
	<li>okay I respect especially the gangsta boo part of the track, but I just didn’t have a great connection with love again; the content of it is perfectly fine, it just felt weird after such a hard set of tracks… although tbf no better place exists on the record, it might just be might least favorite I guess</li>
	<li>I like the storytelling especially on el-p’s verse on crown; this ending is shaping up to just be pretty good, but this slightly slower, more carefully intoned section is I think the only good way to close out a record like this ^^</li>
	<li>yea, I think angel duster closes in that way; it’s a bit of a personal message, and I think it’s definitely a great closer, just not a full hit in its style like a lot of the record reaches in its own way ^

		<ul>
			<li>fantastic closer really to a fantastic record :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
