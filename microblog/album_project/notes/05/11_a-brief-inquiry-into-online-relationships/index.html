<h1>mini notes for a brief inquiry into online relationships</h1>

<ul>
	<li>jesus what a stark contrast of an intro with those piano notes and shrill, blown-out vocals :o</li>
	<li>I honestly don’t have much to comment about give yourself a try; I like the incredibly top-heavy instrumental and the way it explodes into frame at the start, and the vocals have a lot of interesting merit to them ^^</li>
	<li>tootimetootimetootime is a nice little ballad too; I think I appreciate the direction this LP is going in, just not super blown away or anything yet ^</li>
	<li>ooh, that beat switch into (presumably) the second part of how to draw / petrichor is really satisfying :))</li>
	<li>and then we get the best song on the record, no doubt :D

		<ul>
			<li>everything about love it if we made it feels perfect, from those ethereal vocal lines in the background, the absolutely incredible third verse, the strained vocal inflection, the instrumental that explodes at the chorus… everything is so damn perfect :ooo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>be my mistake is a soft little encounter that comes after; I felt it didn’t fit well after the inertia of the previous cut, but nothing much could’ve stemmed from it I guess

		<ul>
			<li>it was a great little cut after, that’s all that matters :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>sincerity is scary is already starting out beautifully with those horns :O

		<ul>
			<li>god that chorus of so many voices feels so damn nice with the way it all comes together :))</li>
			<li>these verses have a lot more merit and expression than I was expecting, absolutely great track ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I’m not sure I fully understand the constant weaving on first listen, but the switching back and forth between common dating encounters and political commentary is a very interesting attribute for the record to have ^

		<ul>
			<li>and while I didn’t as much like the way i like america &amp; america likes me started in that overblown beat… it makes since thematically, and with those wild intricacies in the beat and healy’s incredibly strained vocal performance, it’s hard not to latch onto at the midsection ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the man who married robot / love theme is a weird moment; it makes sense given the LP’s meaning, but god that siri voice is jarring as hell</li>
	<li>inside your mind is a nice little pop ballad, but I don’t know… I’m not getting a ton from it, and I think I feel a bit of a personal separation to the aesthetic and connection the record is attempting to pursue ^</li>
	<li>okay but I’d be lying if it’s not living (if it’s not with you) doesn’t feel absolutely perfect as an upbeat, grossly positive pop track :)

		<ul>
			<li>the fact that it’s directly about a heroin addiction is both saddening and absolutely incredible in the direct, open nature of admitting and growing from that experience :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>surrounded by heads and bodies is a wonderfully creeping, yet simultaneously calming track to follow… this ending is shaping up beautifully on the record</li>
	<li>god the instrumental start to mine is absolutely beautiful, I love the way that piano melody starts things off :O

		<ul>
			<li>holy shit don’t pull the soft jazz card</li>
			<li>god damn this is genuinely beautiful, I can’t get over this mf track :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the downtempo nature of the second to last track is lovely too, especially with that very distinctive vocality from healy; great stuff, I’ve been continuously impressed by this section of the record :)

		<ul>
			<li>THE KEY CHANGE</li>
			<li>the most unexpected, earned moment of the record imo :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I don’t know why, maybe it’s the incredibly upbeat, overblown aesthetic of it, but especially the first verse + chorus of i always wanna die (sometimes) felt gross in comparison to how the previous track ended

		<ul>
			<li>I get more used to it as it goes along, but I never feel positivity in relation to the track, at least rn :/</li>
			<li>kind of a weird, disappointing ending to me :c</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
