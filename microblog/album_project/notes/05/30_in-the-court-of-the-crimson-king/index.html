<h1>mini notes for in the court of the crimson king</h1>

<ul>
	<li>jesus christ, even for 1969 this start to 21st century schizoid man is absolutely incredible and effortlessly unique; the small stanzas of the verses, split with jaw-dropping instrumentals set the stage scarily well for the topic at hand :o

		<ul>
			<li>even just the first line has great imagery, contrasting a cat’s foot with an iron claw as reference to the ongoing vietnam war ^^</li>
			<li>the curt commentary on ptsd and the destruction of countless men’s psyches is just as poignant now… and that jazz-infused instrumental break that takes the majority of the track, before going right back into an even more aggressive stanza</li>
			<li>god what an incredible track :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>besides being a potent, incredible relatable experience to do with god and religion, i talk to the wind has a really great instrumental contrast with the last track… I wouldn’t call it uneasy, because it’s still a relaxing instrumental, but it’s constructed in just the right way

		<ul>
			<li>the flute is the clear, highlighted part of the instrumental, and—especially with the way it closes out the repeated first verse—it’s beautiful :,)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“will no one lay the laurel wreath / when silence drowns the screams?” jesus christ what a line…

		<ul>
			<li>and the second verse, being the most explicit and tacit yet, is heightened by this ‘march for no reason’ that takes place instrumentally afterwards :o</li>
			<li>the way the instrumental grows with those powerful stings after the chorus is another fantastic touch, and just adds to this apocalyptic, dire commentary</li>
			<li>what a fantastic piece in an incredible LP :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while I was initially taken aback by the obviously abstract imagery taking part in the lyrics of moonchild, after three minutes of the instrumental section I think I can understand it pretty well

		<ul>
			<li>that first half (which is really just the first two minutes) is titled “the dream”, and sets up the themes of the second side of this record, being focused on the metaphysical instead of the overtly human (like with the previous three tracks)</li>
			<li>and that, I think, gives immense meaning to these incredible loose improvisations on the following ten minute section, titled “the illusion”</li>
			<li>it’s a mess, and that’s exactly the point, being filled to the brim with microscopic detail, just like the natural world it is attempting to reach :)</li>
			<li>I will be honest in saying the true instrumental on its own is just pretty good; that meaning, I think, has to at least be partially known (like how I am at the moment) to appreciate how weird and non-structured the track is</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and the title track is, as expected, the culmination of everything this record means; it is of the guiding hands of our world, out of sight yet controlling everything around us…

		<ul>
			<li>“the yellow jester does not play / but gently pulls the strings / and smiles as the puppets dance” just a perfect way to close it out</li>
			<li>the medieval themes that start it out, outside of being incredible detailed in their own right, I think is a great way to connect it to past events, and show that this is not a unique happenstance</li>
			<li>this is constant, this is unending, this is unchanging — this is a state of being that even its progenitors are fearful of, because even they cannot control its hand</li>
			<li>perfect album cover, perfect album experience, perfect prog rock masterpiece :D</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
