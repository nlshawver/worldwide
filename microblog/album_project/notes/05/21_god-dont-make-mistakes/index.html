<h1>mini notes for god don’t make mistakes</h1>

<ul>
	<li>huh… I thought I would have a solid opinion of lock load by the end of the track, but I still don’t know how I feel; it’s definitely good at the very least, and I like the little sound bytes that fill out the instrumental

		<ul>
			<li>I just can’t figure out the full sound and my opinion yet tbh</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay I love the instrumental of tear gas though, and this huge verse laid over it is surprisingly great in how it flows through it all, and especially the very direct, hopeful lines about his son :O

		<ul>
			<li>genuinely, the end of that first verse is pretty damn fantastic to me atm :o</li>
			<li>I’m still not a huge weezy fan, but yea his verse here was pretty damn good; rick ross has a good closer too, and I’m glad the instrumental fades out :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>piano love is similar to lock load though, it’s something that needs to sit and grow in my conscious over a lot more listens to appreciate everything here, since I’m still a bit lost; I guess that can be a testament to the levels reached(?)

		<ul>
			<li>I don’t know; it’s definitely good, it’s just not hugely influential on my conscious atm ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>jae skeese rhymed “lock in and vaulted” with “laviska shenault it”… I don’t know why, but in the context of drumwork, that was a great little bar

		<ul>
			<li>I hate that I’m still lost on this record… I don’t not like it, I’m just never connecting with what I think is that true meaning and deeper connection with this record</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I hate to say it, but I think T.I. helped me a bit to get into wild chapters in a deeper way; “license and insurance, give it to ‘em, chill / you either play this shit perfect or you go to jail”

		<ul>
			<li>that’s just a particularly powerful bar to nearly close out his verse with</li>
			<li>and honestly novel’s closing verse adds a great amount to the track too; this may be the first track that I can fully wrap my head around and appreciate really well :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>OOOH okay guilty is a beautiful, sort-of-interlude cut that just explodes with personality; I get a lot more appeal with conway’s flow and voice, and the instrumental floating behind him is lovely

		<ul>
			<li>the very personal bars about how things could’ve gone in his life… it’s the deepest connection to this storybook appearance on his LP yet :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“I part the middle of your head like Larry Johnson” holy shit ahahaha :D

		<ul>
			<li>okay I do really like this track, and it serves incredibly well in the tracklist being placed right after guilty ^^</li>
			<li>benny’s inflection when he spits “that’s why the door on my bedroom thick as a vault” is the best possible closer to his great contribution to this cut :oo</li>
			<li>I might not (atm) have seen a huge impact by westside’s verse, but it certainly was a positive to the cut ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“that’s why I drink a bottle daily / for all the shit I keep bottled in lately”

		<ul>
			<li>stressed is a frightening look into alcoholism as a response to all the shit life throws at you, and the horrors that can stem from how life and death creeps around you…</li>
			<li>the chorus still feels both haunting and surprisingly hopeful, hoping that someone will respond in calm to his jaded request of help… what an absolutely incredible, influential cut :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn, and what a powerful verse again on so much more; that second verse has such a dense, important theme, showing conway’s own useful contributions from all aspects in his life, even if he’s stemmed from the same conditions that keep his community (and so many others) depraved and based in fear

		<ul>
			<li>to be clear, stemmed from the conditions enacted by the state… that’s the clear distinction; it was impossible to escape, and one man cannot topple that system of oppression and unjust influence</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>wow, and yet again chanel pearls is a different kind of beautiful in this tracklist; the sprawling first verse from conway is a great starter, but the contrast into jill scott’s smooth verse right after is absolutely fantastic

		<ul>
			<li>this second half of this record has been verging on perfect; the instrumentals need more attention from myself, but god the introspective content is not lacking at all :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>what a fantastic instrumental behind keisha plum’s intro verse; the esoteric references in her contribution adds a lot to the atmospheric energy of it all, and everything comes together in a creeping, haunting sort of way :O

		<ul>
			<li>conway’s closing verse fits perfectly in this context as well, what a wild experience at the back end of this record ^^</li>
			<li>I don’t think it’s the best track at all, but it certainly serves the record well as a full experience… not on its own as much, but still</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“I walked out the hospital twice / My mother said I died both times, guess I did the impossible twice” it’s not the most intricate section of the track, but thrown in the mix of this calmer, closing track, that type of powerful statement is perfect ^^

		<ul>
			<li>what an incredible closer; this record was a wild experience, and I was worried about how much I might not fully appreciate this LP… but from wild chapters and especially guilty onwards, there was always something that was deftly intriguing or absolutely haunting in just the right way… and sometimes both :o</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
