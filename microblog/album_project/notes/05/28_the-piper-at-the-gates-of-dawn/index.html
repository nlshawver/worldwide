<h1>mini notes for the piper at the gates of dawn</h1>

<ul>
	<li>this is the most pink floyd start to an album I can imagine, and this is the pink floyd that was spearheaded by syd… so I guess it makes sense :)

		<ul>
			<li>the long instrumental break into the almost incoherent second verse / passage is a standout moment for the tracklist imo, as the instrumental is wildly interesting (especially for ’67, which is surprising)</li>
			<li>I feel it cuts off much too briefly though, a bit of a weird moment</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>especially when it goes right into one sounds like the soundtrack of a spy movie lol

		<ul>
			<li>the left side right side part, relating someone to a moral miscommunication between the caring, moral part of their brain to the literal devil… it’s literally the most convoluted, yet incredibly apt, devastating way to describe someone :o</li>
			<li>the track overall is still a bit of a weird mess tbh, I don’t know how to explain it, especially the refrain ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>matilda mother is a genuinely intriguing track though, relating heavily to the want of simple childhood back; it’s a worthwhile moment to realize into a track on this record, but it’s not something that personally piqued my interest entirely or at once</li>
	<li>the springy little harpsichord(?) melody that comes before the guitar section of flaming is a great little moment on the midsection; that was a wild little track, and I think it was the first time I felt confused and immersed in the perfect balance for this record :)</li>
	<li>pow r toc h has an at-times haunting instrumental, shrouded in a mystique that seems to overtake any individual sound at times; it’s a wonderful piece in the midst of these crazed yet calculated shifts in psychedelic rock :o</li>
	<li>what a fucking trip on take up thy stethoscope and walk; the track title already is wild, but the content of both the instrumental and lyrics is just so insane that it’s hard to encapsulate in just words alone…</li>
	<li>great way to get into interstellar overdrive though ngl :o

		<ul>
			<li>while I hold merit and appreciation for the combinations of sounds that, genuinely at times result in a brilliant hodgepodge of both emaciated and gloated freedom… there are definitely moments that just feel like an indulgence into a trip that went sour</li>
			<li>it is not bad by any stretch, and instrumentally encapsulates the whole record perfectly without uttering a single word…sometimes it can just stretch itself a little bit thin I think ^</li>
			<li>might be the best part of the record tho :)</li>
			<li>ooh that moment with 8:15 to go and the way it explodes is absolutely incredible :D</li>
			<li>I heard that little moment before the claps… they’ll use that again ;)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>this is such a mf shift, GNOME MOMENT

		<ul>
			<li>is this about drugs?</li>
			<li>this is definitely about drugs</li>
			<li>yup, this is about drugs :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>with the bass and soundscape that comes alongside chapter 24, it may hold a place in my mind as the best moment on the record despite the sprawling vocals

		<ul>
			<li>it seems to actually hold up very damn well, and the lyrics sit calmly between chaos and confusion, and supreme meaning to even a sober person</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I have to be honest though… the scarecrow just feels out of place :c

		<ul>
			<li>that first two verse combination is just alright, ending on a kind note into the instrumental rise— but it seems to just sit and fade, accomplishing only minimal influence with its effort ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yea and I understand the point of bicycle (drugs in a different way, more focused on the instrument of transportation), but god it is just so grating, summed up perfectly with the ending chaos

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a worthwhile sound, but a lot is just not connecting rn</li>
			<li>that duck noise is both hilarious and haunting at the same time though, jesus christ :o</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
