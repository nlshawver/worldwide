<h1>mini notes for i,i</h1>

<ul>
	<li>alright, interesting instrumental start with yi; let’s go :)</li>
	<li>I really like the way imi reaches to instrumentally around the halfway point, but all the meaning of the track seems lost in how just weird and barely audible so much of the vocals are

		<ul>
			<li>the vocal effects aren’t helping my enjoyment or understanding of any vague meaning at all either :/</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while the peak / chorus of we feels great compared to what’s around it, again it just feels like a loose collection of thoughts that never form something concrete, definable, or… interesting</li>
	<li>I do like the way holyfields closes, especially with the little explosion on the bridge on its way to the chorus, but there’s no personal connection I feel to the moment; it’s fleeting in its value to me, and it’s hard to conceptualize the merit this record holds</li>
	<li>I’m appreciating 22am more and more tbh</li>
	<li>I think hey ma might hold the best amount of emotional weight in its lyrics, but god the instrumental is the thing that doesn’t do anything for me; it’s plucky in the way it backs behind the vocals, not expanding on them interestingly

		<ul>
			<li>and it’s not even a lack of patience, I can usually love slow burns and emotive experiences…</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>like that track and u (man like) that comes after, but so many aspects of it feel like random musical snaps that have quick attack in their appearance, but no reverb to sustain their meaning and importance

		<ul>
			<li>I mean… yes, the chorus stemming from vernon, wasner, and jensen feels like a good culmination of sound and sonic relevance, but the track’s over and there’s nothing resting on my tongue, nothing that seems to give meaning to its placement</li>
			<li>its vignettes of sound, and I’m just not connecting with any of those nodes that keep reaching out</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>until naeem, genuinely; that feels like the first truly discrete, intriguing culmination of those emotions

		<ul>
			<li>that may be because it’s structured in a more cohesive methodology, but genuinely the way it combines those sonic pieces and closes in the way it does (with that outro)…</li>
			<li>beautiful track :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>it may just be the prose in his verses that refuses to connect with me; my god, I understand the point of the track in its focus on climate and disparities, and suffering… but the vocal lines feel broken and scattered, almost aimless…</li>
	<li>and faith, while exciting in its instrumentation and the way it ethereally grows to that peak… is that exciting cut that does nothing for me as well; I don’t know how to describe, but it’s like there’s no substance</li>
	<li>although- marion has a shimmering instrumental, feeling like a lincoln log hut in a snow-covered maple forest… now that I make connections to the track I think there finds that inner meaning

		<ul>
			<li>I fear it’s much too late, but the energy of the track forms well in my conscious, the painting it makes coming together in a cohesive, meaningful way, just for a brief moment or two :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>salem is a good continuation, but with little more substance to it; the peak is ethereally beautiful though, and that cut ending—while harsh—feels deliberately important and meaningful to the theme ^^</li>
	<li>the meaning of the title of the twelfth track is just morbidly misinformed to me; while it may not take away from that saxophone on the track itself, I find it irresponsible; this shit is not new, this is all planned, and its just the easy, at-times-incorrect target imo

		<ul>
			<li>I get it can feel like a culmination of everything shitty, but it just feels grossly oversimplified in my eyes</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>rabi doesn’t have much to close out in my conscious, just leaving on a nothing moment; the vocals are pretty over that unique, sprawling instrumental, but it doesn’t feel significant or faded enough to be the outro… it just feels the same…</li>
</ul>
