<h1>mini notes for ventura</h1>

<ul>
	<li>ooh what a classic introduction, beautiful drum fills and freestyling coming into come home :)

		<ul>
			<li>both of paak’s verses are pretty well attuned for this track, and his vocals are beautiful as always c:</li>
			<li>HOLY MOLY andre goes absolutely insane on the ending of an already amazing verse :DD</li>
			<li>“you know I’m sufferin’, I do miss my friend / I don’t like my fin bent up, Tilikum, well, that’s ill-informed / sweet stuff, Willa Wonk’, we stuck, Billabong / ‘least at minimum we gon’ get along / peace and inner calm, geez, it’s been a long / t-i-m-e, um, please, I’m feeling dumb”</li>
			<li>how tf are you doing that :ooo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly the first verse of make it better didn’t do a ton for me, but I like the way the chorus faintly expands after the strangers in the night line, and the second verse is rly good :)

		<ul>
			<li>alright that extended chorus / outro is a great way to close it out, extending these pleas and forming the track into something much more overtly bitter yet a bit hopeful :o</li>
			<li>great cut :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh that closing, extended note of the first chorus is magic :O

		<ul>
			<li>honestly that beat switch is kinda nice after a good first start, but the way it meanders is a bit distracting… not bad at all obviously, I think that’s impossible with paak, but it’s definitely less focused in its theme and execution imo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay so this song is about paak effortlessly winning, I see how it is

		<ul>
			<li>damnn okay that third verse is fantastic in the way his voice changes compared to the rest; lovely little closer with that tad more energy :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly this is a really nice interlude with jazmine, it’s a good trade back and forth, and I feel like it honestly could’ve served really damn well as its own track; that’s literally the only thing I would change ab it :)</li>
	<li>yada yada is pretty good too, a nice way to come out of that sullivan feature; definitely the best part is the label shade and the way paak expresses himself, so business as usual ;)</li>
	<li>ooh great transition into king james, great stuff so far on the instrumental and vocals here so far too :O

		<ul>
			<li>I think honestly that’s just a pretty good track; there’s not a ton to separate it stylistically from the previous two tracks especially, even if the messaging is good for the track ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that sonyae elise hook is incredible on chosen one tho, and that more upbeat instrumental that sometimes comes just a little offbeat gives this cut a lot of personality to it that I rly like :)

		<ul>
			<li>wtf haha was not expecting that DOOM line :D</li>
			<li>that real verse from paak is pretty good, and the best possible way to split up those choruses (which I could understand as being just a bit weird, given most of this track is chorus and outro) but it’s such a nostalgic feeling, combined with just the right amount of indulgence and unique personality &amp; instrumentation to make it stick out in a pretty way for me :)</li>
			<li>yea the end to that outro is really beautiful c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>“baby, that ass is just unfair” …incredible ;)

		<ul>
			<li>tbh though jet black is a great follow-up with that booming kick drum and the really nice brandy feature to follow it up, with the female singers supporting perfectly with paak’s vocal inflections :)</li>
			<li>it has a very similar energy, and I think some of it delves too deep into those pop-ish ventures, but it’s nowhere near bad (even if the end is closest to underwhelming)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>woah, not the instrumental I was expecting with twilight :o

		<ul>
			<li>honestly I think it’s just pretty good; there’s nothing wrong with it, but it passes by harmlessly in a beige kinda vibe (to me at least)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy fuck… I was not expecting the nate dogg feature, and hate that it slipped my mind of his passing eleven years ago…

		<ul>
			<li>what a monumentally perfect track, I can 100% see the mortal man connection with pac, and I love the way this can work on its own, not needing such extended breaks for importance to feel merited… not saying mortal man is bad at all, but- you know what I mean</li>
			<li>goddamn I just didn’t expect that, and I absolutely love that track</li>
			<li>beautiful closer, that may have genuinely flipped a switch for this album to make it something more I never expected :o</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
