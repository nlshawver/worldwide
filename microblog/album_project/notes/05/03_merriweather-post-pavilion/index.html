<h1>mini notes for merriweather post pavilion</h1>

<ul>
	<li>holy shit- I was a bit tame and tepid with the feel of in the flowers, starting off the record, but the way the track just spontaneously combusts into shrill chaos at the bridge is insane :OO

		<ul>
			<li>that chorus is both harrowing and incredibly infectious :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>my girls is a weird but really affectionate moment after the drug fueled trip of the track just before; the overt comments of want after being satisfied with family is a pensive, touching feeling :)

		<ul>
			<li>yea, especially with the way the pre-chorus grows in meaning—</li>
			<li>I might be a bit less interested with the chorus in how it comes off instrumentally, but the content of the track as a whole outweighs that feeling atm ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I&#39;m not connecting a ton with the following track, but I can&#39;t ignore the wild mess of an instrumental and the &quot;two lanterns&quot; and dreamy energy of the cut as a whole :o</li>
	<li>oh my god... the way summertime clothes has some great and very relatable imagery for me— but damn THAT MF CHORUS is so dreamy, so perfectly pop-ish; it&#39;s an oasis of pure happiness :DD

		<ul>
			<li>&quot;let&#39;s meander at an easy pace&quot; right before the continued explosion of ear candy is beautiful stuff :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>again, daily routine was something I didn&#39;t connect at first with given the abrasive sounds, but the ending and the way it morphed up to that point was endearing</li>
	<li>and wow the way it precedes so well into bluish is really appealing; that crazed, sharp harp(?) above electric chaos is somehow organized in just the right way to be shockingly pleasing :)

		<ul>
			<li>that chorus feels just the right amount of playful with the vocal lines; absolutely lovely track w that ending outro too :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the song after it is about masturbation</li>
	<li>taste is genuinely just a sort of intermediary moment for me; it&#39;s all good, but just not nearly as standout

		<ul>
			<li>maybe that&#39;s a great thing for this record, to have a bit of the same while focusing on a different theme / giving your brain a break, but just pointing it out rn</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>gotta love that mouth harp (:

		<ul>
			<li>okay but honestly similar moods towards this track; the verses feel chaotic in more so a needless kinda way—that bass that kicks off the third verse is a great moment, but I&#39;m just a bit excited ab this track ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay... I&#39;m back with this in full; no more runnin is absolutely beautiful, I love the almost jungle noises in the background, and the comments on initial worries turned committed happiness :))</li>
	<li>not sure how I feel about that ending tho; brother sport is a wild afro-beat trip, but I feel less steady than I did at the feet of no more runnin ^</li>
</ul>
