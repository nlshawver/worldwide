<h1>mini notes for hybrid theory</h1>

<ul>
	<li>god all of this nostalgia :D

		<ul>
			<li>papercut is an incredible intro to this album, and such an amazing statement for linkin park to begin their career with :O</li>
			<li>god that thumping bass drum just gets to me :ooo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and right into this mf track with one step closer :O

		<ul>
			<li>it’s gonna be non-stop isn’t it? yea it’s gonna be non-stop</li>
			<li>while this is their basic, intro song for anyone new, this is still a banger to this day; I don’t care about any of their later discog, this track and album is so mf iconic :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>with you might be one of the better deep cuts here, the layered vocals of the chorus tie it together really, really well; great stuff :)</li>
	<li>points of authority is absolutely incredible too, every minute element of it (even if minute in this context is ear-crushing) is incessantly catchy, tactile, and crafted in perfection of a long-dormant genre</li>
	<li>ah right, nevermind- crawling is the basic opener for this band

		<ul>
			<li>while I think this isn’t bad, it’s certainly not as good as young me thought it was; it’s a bit weird, wary, and not as endearing as previous or future cuts on this record imo</li>
			<li>it still explodes with that chorus tho, my god :o</li>
			<li>whatever that sound is right after the song is, as I will describe it as “a saw in a bottle” is so iconic to this record ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>runaway is another rly good cut in the mix of great tracks, not much else to say tbh</li>
	<li>my god, by myself starts with what sounds like huge industrial machinery slamming into itself; I can’t identify that sound specifically, but listening reveals it really well :O

		<ul>
			<li>the slower parts don’t do as much for me, but they seem vital for this track to survive, so I think it’s worthwhile ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>this mf song, in the end is another insanely popular track from this record… I think this one deserves it a bit more than crawling, its so incessantly catchy, nostalgic, stuck-in-its-time in a charming way, and even if that chorus is a bit overdone… god its too iconic :))</li>
	<li>a place for my head has a really great cadence to it, with that stuttering, almost mangled guitar leads driving through the whole track; I think some of the lyrics aren’t nearly as impressive, but its still really damn good

		<ul>
			<li>the ending is hard as hell, but in terms of total merit… it’s just alright in relation to a lot of the rest of this record</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the first half and style of forgotten is a good continuation of a place for my head, but its not a perfect follow-up at all imo

		<ul>
			<li>not bad at all though, I have to admit; that chorus is surprisingly melodic and well-formed</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I think I have a distinctly personal connection to cure for the itch; it’s a bit of a ridiculous venture in the album, and the voiceover is a bit much… but I think I genuinely gained a lot of appreciation for hip-hop production and the way it could form and morph just from this track

		<ul>
			<li>I could tell it was a whole lot different from what I grew up with from my parents, and that style of sound-crushing and mixing, along with completely foreign, spritely sounds drew me in and never let go, even if I had forgotten about this track long ago</li>
			<li>well, until today at least :)</li>
			<li>it’s a lovely interlude on the album ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>pushing me away is a nice little closer, even if its not as iconoclastic or endearing as a few other tracks here; it’s a rigid, great ending with shinoda’s vocals backing up chester’s leads really well :)

		<ul>
			<li>yea that final note is lovely :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
