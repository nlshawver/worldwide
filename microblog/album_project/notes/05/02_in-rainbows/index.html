<h1>mini notes for in rainbows</h1>

<ul>
	<li>wow, that wild beat in 5/4 alongside the effects that get torn into the mix towards the end of 15 step are absolutely incredible :O</li>
	<li>god bodysnatchers starts off perfectly, that overbearing, crushing riff :oo

		<ul>
			<li>that bridge and outro are so mf good, my god... two tracks in and I&#39;m blown away :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>nude is absolutely beautiful too, the bass really ties the calmer aesthetic together really well—that extended note from yorke at the end of the second chorus is incredible ^

		<ul>
			<li>the orchestration too :OO</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>weird fishes/arpeggi is such a weird, wild trip; the meaning is all there but the lyrics are so out there and dipped in random complexities

		<ul>
			<li>that interlude into yorke&#39;s outro is amazing though, on top of the rest of the track :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>jesus that bass on all i need :oo

		<ul>
			<li>god the piano and drums that come in together at the end of this cut are mesmerizing :OOO</li>
			<li>it&#39;s not a lot of happy emotions, or at all, but god these tracks have been beautiful :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>i love faust arp and the stream-of-consciousness approach to the lyrics, just blurting out instead if being so calculated as is usual for thom

		<ul>
			<li>the meaning is also chilling, but it sounds nice; might as well be happy by that and not look into the existential themes :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>reckoner is almost haunting in its instrumentation, with thom&#39;s vocals being particularly ethereal after that bridge section and the background vocals muttering &quot;in rainbows&quot;

		<ul>
			<li>the way the instrumental pops back in is lovely :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>house of cards is absolutely amazing... the way the instrumental just pops in, the minute intricacies of how it grows, and the constant want of thom&#39;s character inhibitions to persuade a woman to run off and get swept up away from these established structures

		<ul>
			<li>it&#39;s incredible, nothing much else to say :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>woah, those strings in the middle of jigsaw falling into place are what really got me; the lead-up from the second sprawling verse, and into the final chorus are perfectly chaotic and endearing in its thematic intricacies :))</li>
	<li>videotape is what got me... that chaotic sampled drum, the cadence and offset rhythm of the piano—it&#39;s a fantastic backdrop to some of the most ethereally creeping and show-stopping lyricism with yorke&#39;s singing

		<ul>
			<li>this was an incredible experience to go through again ^^^</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
