<h1>mini notes for boy in da corner</h1>

<ul>
	<li>honestly, I was confused and underwhelmed at the onset of this track, but by the third verse, enough had happened—and along with the introspection of the third verse, it turned into a pretty good album opener to a genre I am not well versed in at all ^^</li>
	<li>oh my god… stop dat was another track that I felt off at the start, but damnn, that chorus into the second verse was absolutely incredible with the harsh, simple bass line :O

		<ul>
			<li>the outro instrumental and vocals pair very, very nicely as well :)</li>
			<li>I’m starting to get the style a bit more… just a bit, but more than nothing at all ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit the minimalist production and compression is absolutely crushing and oblique on i luv u… it feels claustrophobic and enraging with such a wild connection to infidelity, sex, and infatuation :oo</li>
	<li>okay okay, brand new day’s instrumental took a good amount of acclimation to be near as interested in it as the previous cuts, but the lyrics on the cut are by far the most interesting so far, much more conscious and overtly emotional; absolutely fantastic stuff so far :D

		<ul>
			<li>was not expecting for these first four tracks to put such an impact on me ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooooh on that second verse that insane bass line comes through perfectly under dizzee’s voice :D

		<ul>
			<li>god it’s such a fuckin earworm :OOO</li>
			<li>it’s much more of a confident turn from the previous track, not as emotionally interesting… but god it doesn’t have to be, these at-times braggadocious lines are a great fit ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>while it wasn’t bad at all, especially in the context of this record, fix up look sharp is so far the least interesting track to me; nothing wildly intriguing pops up as easily as what came of the former five cuts ^</li>
	<li>the rhyming of “hackney and bow” with “ridiculously low” is perfect at the start haha

		<ul>
			<li>cut em off has a pretty solid beat and rhymes over it; maybe better than the former, but some of the merit of the record is slipping a bit for me ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly hold ya mouf was another cut that just didn’t satisfy much for me; not bad, just not interesting to me at least</li>
	<li>and I think round we go is a track that fits well in the record, but it’s just another track that doesn’t have the same former appeal to me :/</li>
	<li>oooh see okay, jus a rascal starts off a bit grating, but that beat with the driving guitar under dizzee’s crazed, lightning-in-a-bottle verse is such a return to that higher energy and interesting instrumental that the first third of the record showed off in spades :)

		<ul>
			<li>the following verse is pretty good too, and the chorus is growing on me (just a bit) with the instrumental behind it now ^</li>
			<li>holy shit and that final verse is so grimy and crazed, perfect ending right before the plucky strings :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I do like the repetition on the first verse of wot u on, it’s a nice motif to have in a track like this ^^

		<ul>
			<li>that crunchy, compressed bass line and soft synth lead in the background is a hypnotizing combination :O</li>
			<li>and again, the chorus is much better to my ears rn with the instrumental right alongside with it :)</li>
			<li>this is just another nice, indulgent sort of track; makes sense given the themes of the real world dizzee dealt with and a money-centric society (very specific ik)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>honestly I wasn’t super into jezebel, but the final lines hold a good amount of meaning comparatively to the rest of the track ^</li>
	<li>holy shit that second verse of seems 2 be is such an earworm, especially the backslash bar and what comes around it :D

		<ul>
			<li>the beat is also absolutely insane, what a track :o</li>
			<li>DING DONG</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>live o is (if you can even try to be with such a beat) is just a bit less insane than the previous cut, and I think that gives a bit more space for his vocals and lyrics to grow and show off more; I don’t think it’s always perfect, or great, but it’s certainly a great track on the very backend of this record :)</li>
	<li>oh my god, with this beat, the message and theme of the closing track is so much more influential and heart-stopping with how significant it carries itself

		<ul>
			<li>what a fantastic closer to a genuinely great, classic album; it’s never perfect, never completely refined, but that’s no doubt exactly the point :))</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
