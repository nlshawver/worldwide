<h1>mini notes for mos def and talib kweli are black star</h1>

<ul>
	<li>while I wasn’t entirely blown away by the verses themselves, the beat and introduction of mos def (yasiin bey) and kweli into this LP was really damn good :)</li>
	<li>damn, mos def’s start on definition is absolutely incredible with that rickety, steady beat :O

		<ul>
			<li>that interpolation on the hook is kinda nice, but I’m still focused on the staggering verses from both; the proclamations from both interweave in emotion perfectly :D</li>
			<li>god damn that ending :ooo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit the follow-up in re: definition is a great continuation- and my GOD mos def’s verse that closes it out before the last hook is another standout moment for me so far :D</li>
	<li>okay obviously children’s story is just a kinda long interlude, but I can’t help but feel it’s a weird way to convey what’s trying to be said; it’s an interesting medium at the very least</li>
	<li>I do really love brown skin lady right after; the very casual beat and ethereal keys (and reverb out in the background) compliments both mos def and kweli’s vocal notes :))

		<ul>
			<li>that outro by kweli is actually really nice, it’s a perfectly casual and simultaneously introspective statement about beauty standards; great stuff to hear from a record from the 90’s :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>with vinia mojica’s vocal adlibs in the background, talib’s first verse is a beautiful little start to this cut; this style is always, always lovely, especially when you have mos def, kweli, and possibly the best feature on this record (I will hold my breath for common though)

		<ul>
			<li>seriously, I love K.O.S. (determination) so much :D</li>
			<li>the verses that follow after the first hook by mojica are great monologues by kweli; I can’t sum up all he’s saying, but the gattaca line, the self-determination comments… it’s all amazing :)</li>
			<li>I love how mos def is just sitting in the background ad-libbing ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>woah, that first verse on hater players with that deep beat under kweli was somehow still a unique experience; all the tracks are similar in the faces featured, but each track is always different in the way it carries itself, both lyrically and instrumentally :o

		<ul>
			<li>god yea that shuddering beat does wonders under def’s verse too :O</li>
			<li>the ending is alright if I’m being honest, but the rest of the track outweighs any of those feelings ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>yo yeah is by far the best interlude on this album; the commentaries from the young girl, older woman, and then the older man at the end are all lovely little moments to think in the midst of this experience :o</li>
	<li>god damn… genuinely the best feeling ever on this record from mos def’s starting verse and the “breathe in / breathe out” on the chorus :OO

		<ul>
			<li>this track is absolutely incredible with the effortless rhymes and perfectly intoned beat behind it all; the guitar is a fantastic addition to add to that slightly foggy atmosphere :D</li>
			<li>the spanish right before the third verse is a beautiful touch, it matches so well with this energy ^</li>
			<li>holy shit… common is an absolute treat :ooo</li>
			<li>I have nothing else to say, that track is stellar :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I was a bit tepid at first with thieves in the night, but this is genuinely the best continuation after respiration; the calm beat with vocals edging on high-energy proclamations at times is a great moment for the LP

		<ul>
			<li>that chorus is absolutely lovely too :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and again, I was worried about the start of twice inna lifetime because both jane doe and wordsmith felt much too harsh for a cut at the end of the record… but with this beat, and the content of what they’re all proclaiming on this cut…

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a great ending :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
