<h1>mini notes for father of the bride</h1>

<ul>
	<li>there’s no good way to describe what happens on the first track, but the trading of vocals back and forth, along with that stuttering, chopped up instrumental was a pretty good start to this LP :)</li>
	<li>god and I don’t know what it is about the combination of the verses and that almost dreamy chorus, but harmony hall is such a lovely indie pop track; at the very least for my ears, it checks every single box for compelling instrumentation and a lovely crescendo :D</li>
	<li>it was a simple little interlude, but the little “ehh…to an extent” at the end of bambina was the best part lol</li>
	<li>while it’s not my favorite cut from them by a good distance, and that drum ending was a bit meh for me, this life was a great little track (especially with those subtle little additions to make it stand out…mainly the stuttering vocals)</li>
	<li>i’m gonna be honest though, big blue just kinda came and went</li>
	<li>the background of how long? is just a bit of okay instrumentation, that overblown kick and the mushiness of the rest is a bit wary; the vocals are good, but I’m not feeling a ton from this track</li>
	<li>what the hell that orchestra hit caught me off guard lol</li>
	<li>unbearably white is a nice, slightly understated cut; those wild strings on the instrumental break was really nice too :o

		<ul>
			<li>I’m not really feeling much from the verses, but this is only first listen; it’s still one of the better tracks so far ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>rich man was an interesting little interlude to follow, but I’m just not feeling much from a lot of these tracks so far :/</li>
	<li>yea married in a gold rush was good at times, but never as interesting as I maybe made it out in my mind to be (given what I know about VW’s former works and what to expect)</li>
	<li>my mistake isn’t much different…

		<ul>
			<li>I don’t know, I like that little split in the track, but it seems not to amount to much to the track; nothing happens because of it I guess is a good way to say it</li>
			<li>I might not as looked that deeply into the lyrics as I suspected</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>woah was not expecting sympathy :o

		<ul>
			<li>that chorus does sound really great honestly, damn :O</li>
			<li>~ that bass line ~</li>
			<li>maybe didn’t end as great as the rest of the track was to me, but not a bad exciting cut to have at this point in the record</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>this mf song

		<ul>
			<li>I think this is one of those songs that’s great to listen to…maybe once or twice</li>
			<li>I don’t know, somehow a lot of this record just isn’t doing much for me right now; it’s not bad, just sprawling and constantly shifting, never giving me enough of something to latch onto</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I guess unfortunately the most compelling part of flower moon to me is steve lacy’s deeper voice and the way it plays well with the backing instrumental; maybe I’m just in a bit of a rut with VW in terms of koenig’s voice and the incredibly consistent (yet sometimes much too similar) styling of his music

		<ul>
			<li>yea the lyrics here just aren’t incredibly spectacular, and koenig spreading out vocally on that chorus gets to me a bit :c</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>2021 just passes by me too, not much that stuck out to me :/</li>
	<li>…I can’t not be honest, we belong together is almost insufferable for me; there’s just nothing to it, it’s a boring ‘love song’ that just amounts to little on my brain

		<ul>
			<li>I won’t even remember this by the time we get to the end of this stretched-out album, even if the end is only ten minutes away</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I think a lot of the singing on stranger comes across as really nice, but the cohesion of the actual meaning of the track is a bit…lacking in terms of that little something that makes a track feel unique, special, and meaningful (especially in an album context)</li>
	<li>spring snow was nice, and it’s the most touching of the ‘interludes’ that come and go I think ^</li>
	<li>I do kinda like the anti-climax on the chorus, and I can definitely understand this sort of introspection relating to koenig’s identity; I guess for the ending of this record, this is a not-half bad track

		<ul>
			<li>I’m just a bit at a loss for the album as a whole; this is a good track for the end :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
