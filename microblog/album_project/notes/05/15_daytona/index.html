<h1>mini notes for daytona</h1>

<ul>
	<li>alright this ye production is already doing wonders for this project, my god; that first bridge and the second verse of if you know you know is incredible :D</li>
	<li>damn I love that goya montoya line on the third verse of the games we play; I definitely like the more plain lyrical ability on this track, even if the instrumental does more wonders on the opening cut ^</li>
	<li>okay okay I really like hard piano, especially the way the instrumental shifts just slightly in line with rick ross’s verse; I have a bit of waning confidence though, but I’m holding out ofc</li>
	<li>that george jackson sample is amazing, and a really great contrast / connection, serving as the chorus; the verses are pretty good too, but I’m still a bit skittish… not sure why, but am</li>
	<li>that refrain from 070 shake is really damn good, and I do really like the way the beat lingers in a subtle way at push’s third verse; that’s probably the closest track that’s been as interesting to me (right now) as the opener ^</li>
	<li>what would meek do is a pretty good cut too, and I like the bounces between ye and push; that maga hat line was iconic though wtf :o</li>
	<li>infrared is a standout closing track though, with all those digs against birdman, drake, wayne… the messaging over a relatively subtle instrumental and great sample is a good closer to this project ^</li>
</ul>
