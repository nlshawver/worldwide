<h1>mini notes for ginger</h1>

<ul>
	<li>honestly, while I didn’t feel much from its first play-through, no halo was a pretty good start to this record; I’m worried based on what I’ve heard about this record, but I remain hopeful for the way this grows</li>
	<li>ohhh okay I know sugar for sure- that ryan beatty chorus is alright, but honestly it’s just grating to my ears for some reason (maybe it being overplayed, maybe the way it sounds completely mismatched to the rest of the track, idrk for sure)

		<ul>
			<li>it’s not a bad track, but I feel nothing but slight mediocrity from it</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and boy bye is honestly not much better to my ears, maybe worse; the first moment that I think is genuinely good is kevin abstract’s way too short verse midway through ^^

		<ul>
			<li>god I don’t want to not like this LP, but I’m just getting no feeling from it at all :c</li>
			<li>that ending instrumental is kinda cool at least ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>somehow slowthai’s lone contribution on heaven belongs to you is more interesting than the previous two tracks… don’t know if that’s a good turn or what—</li>
	<li>honestly st. percy starts off pretty alright, and while it doesn’t grow or evolve in a influential manner all that much, it’s a great little track in this mix in all honesty; kevin, matt, and merlyn I think are the peaks, being the first two verses and the outro :)</li>
	<li>it transitions really well into if you pray right too; I’m glad the instrumental stretches a bit, and merlyn &amp; abstract have great moments again on the track

		<ul>
			<li>it’s just a pretty good continuation of st. percy ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>holy shit that instrumental on dearly departed… WHERE WAS THIS THE WHOLE TIME :O

		<ul>
			<li>by far the most interesting turn, with kevin’s verse being a great stepping stone into a fantastic hook from joba :D</li>
			<li>this is the best track so far, bar none :)</li>
			<li>it feels so much more genuine, and the personal feelings interlaced in the lyrics come through so much mf better; it’s genuinely almost a disservice not to surround this track with even more good material (not identical to this, but as clear and genuinely intriguing in similar methods) ^^</li>
			<li>holy shit dom’s ending is powerful as all hell, with such a perfect stream of consciousness into an explosion of emotion :oo</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>damn, and i been born again feels so much more influential coming after dearly departed; it’s a fantastic continuation into a similar, differently attuned response to the feelings of the previous cut :o</li>
	<li>ginger feels like a calmer yet still confidently expressive cut; not in the instrumental or inflections being too harsh or loud, but in the overtly discrete, laid-out lines from mainly kevin abstract and matt champion

		<ul>
			<li>they both provide the right amount of personality to the cut, and the outro being taken over by other members is a nice touch :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>and while big boy is definitely the final comedown after dearly departed onward, it still contains a good amount of value, especially with joba’s pretty good contribution; it’s not fantastic or incredibly deep, but that direct line of thinking he displays is valuable to this cut ^^

		<ul>
			<li>that outro is a weird, but wild moment that adds a bit of chaos to an otherwise organized cut :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I think love me for life is just pretty good too; I’ve come to understand it in the context of this record, and while merlyn provides a verse that doesn’t fit well on these listens… it’s useful, even if it’s more shallow</li>
	<li>damn, and victor roberts closes out the tracklist in a mellow, yet huge sort of way, with a fantastic performance from the man the track is named after

		<ul>
			<li>this took much too long to become an interesting, valuable experience, but the way it grew was genuinely staggering :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
