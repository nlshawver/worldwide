<h1>mini notes for blue lines</h1>

<ul>
	<li>already an incredible bass line on safe from harm :o

		<ul>
			<li>I like the trading of chorus and pre + post choruses between shara and 3d, the unique timbre of both of their voices together is a great part of the cut :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay I don’t want to take away from it so soon after the LP started, but I’m not getting much out of one love; the instrumental is perfectly fine, but the verses feel so generic in their delivery and especially the lyrics</li>
	<li>ooh okay the title track has rekindled a lot here; that jazz instrumental is perfect, especially the little peak around when 3d first comes in, and this trading back and forth between him, tricky, and occasionally daddy g throughout the track is absolutely incredible :D

		<ul>
			<li>that final lyric is perfect :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>be thankful for what you’ve got is a great little cover; it’s a nice transition after the title track, and the theme is a great one to have at this point of the record ^</li>
	<li>damnn okay, willy wee’s first verse on five man army is the best raw verse I’ve heard so far :O

		<ul>
			<li>I thought a lot of the remaining verses (bar a few moments on the first verse right after) were pretty good as well… and while I like the ability for the beat to breathe under the horace andy interlude, it’s a bit dragged out ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>unfinished sympathy is definitely a nice moment after five man army, but it’s nothing crazy to me so far in this LP; the samples are great though, I have to admit ^^</li>
	<li>honestly daydreaming is just a pretty good track here; this is a record where I can definitely appreciate the emergence of a definite style, but it’s not connecting as much as other material has been ^

		<ul>
			<li>I do have to point out this is at least the third time he’s mentioned the sony budokan / boodo khan walkman, and it wasn’t great the first time</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>lately is nice in the aesthetic that it’s forming, but it’s not incredible for much else; maybe I’m being overly harsh, this record is just getting less and less interesting as I go :/</li>
	<li>hymn of the big wheel is another one where my interest just stays at a flat line; there’s just nothing here to get me involved, intrigued, or roped in :c</li>
</ul>
