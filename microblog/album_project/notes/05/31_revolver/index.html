<h1>mini notes for revolver</h1>

<ul>
	<li>great little dig on tax collectors in britain as the start of this album (:

		<ul>
			<li>I don’t really have much else to say, great guitar work tho :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oooh classic w eleanor rigby :D

		<ul>
			<li>honestly it was mainly the third verse that stuck out to me, but it had a good amount of interesting, kinda vague imagery that felt appealing or (at least) intriguing</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay and I’m starting to get the wide appeal in the experimental nature of the record with i’m only sleeping, especially with george’s backwards guitar solo :OO

		<ul>
			<li>genuinely a really cool moment, and the fact that it’s just fed backwards through a tape machine is incredible c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>jesus christ and love you to is such a wild cut, with just george singing and playing the sitar (with ringo being the only other one, playing the tambourine lol)

		<ul>
			<li>absolutely incredible track with the meaning behind the lyrics, and the inflection and flow of george’s voice :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh I heard that little tape skip or reverb before the third verse of here, there and everywhere ;)

		<ul>
			<li>honestly this is just a really good ballad, it fits in surprisingly well after the previous cut, and it just has such a wonderful energy surrounding its instrumentation and lyrics ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>this mf song

		<ul>
			<li>yellow submarine is such a weird track to have here, especially given the fact that it’s just a children’s song, with an understated acid trip happening in the background?</li>
			<li>I really don’t know, but it’s not my favorite beatles song ever for sure :/</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>oh my god another great instrumental on she said she said, both especially with the drums and guitar(s) :D

		<ul>
			<li>honestly just a really good closer to the first half of the record, I love it :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay I took a break with notes, but while I never recognized any of the tracks that took place on the second half, god the instrumentals were genuinely shocking at some points</li>
	<li>iirc, good day sunshine, for no one, and tomorrow never knows were the tracks that really stuck out to me, either for their lyrical content, instrumentals, but usually both ^^</li>
	<li>fantastic album, even if I don’t completely understand the huge appeal of it at times :)</li>
</ul>
