<h1>mini notes for 22, a million</h1>

<ul>
	<li>woah, I really like the jittery nature of the way 22 starts… (also I’m not gonna type the full names of the tracks cause that’s too hard)

		<ul>
			<li>that saxophone is lovely to add to this weird mix :o</li>
			<li>wow and that third verse was great in the expression in vernon’s voice :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>DAMN was not expecting that type of deep, jolting instrumental on 10 :O

		<ul>
			<li>holy shit the way this grows with that crushing instrumental and the “love, don’t fight it” repetition into the final lyrics is insane…</li>
			<li>I feel it cuts harshly, but that feels par for the course in this so far ^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>that deep vocal effect on vernon’s voice is another weird, wild touch on 715; I’m not sure how I feel about a lot of the placement and cohesion of this record so far, but I can’t judge it for not being adventurous or incredibly unique compared to anything I could’ve expected :o</li>
	<li>that chorus shift into the light-feeling second verse on 33 is shockingly interesting, that deep drum beat is great to hear under these ethereal chords and vernon’s unique inflection :)

		<ul>
			<li>the way it ends feels disjointed and stuttered, but in a good way this time ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the “paramind, paramind” that closes the first chorus of 29 is a great end to how other-worldly the vocals feel over such a normal sounding instrumental :))

		<ul>
			<li>god that distortion at the ending chorus feels so powerful because of the relation to the track’s stylings; absolutely amazing track, and the first real steady respite I’ve felt since the intro track :D</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I was a bit wary on the start of 666, thinking not much of it, but that explosion of the second chorus was immaculately timed; feels incredible in the folds of this record ^

		<ul>
			<li>oh my god that ending is an earworm, my god :O</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>I like the transition straight into 21, it’s a great little moment to keep things moving, and into a nice instrumental that starts it off :)

		<ul>
			<li>I feel like the chaotic nature of it can almost be a detriment to it at times, but the stuttering saxophone saves it a bit, it feels ridiculous and creepy at the same time :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>great transition again, damn :O

		<ul>
			<li>the more lengthy vocal melodies on 8 feel a lot better on this track, and I think this is the first great track since 29 imo; a bit of the experimental energy served almost as a slight kneecapping earlier, and I think these lengthier, deeper, and more personal (while still unique) cuts are the actual peak of this record (so far) ^^</li>
			<li>yea that simple drum beat coming under the horns is satisfying after all the chaotic noises prior; I think that’s part of the relief aspect, so that might be the point… idk, this just sounds really damn good, so I’ll enjoy it :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the horns and banjo make a nice combination on 45, but I think that track does more as a nice interlude; it doesn’t add a ton I don’t think</li>
	<li>the vocal lines and lyrics in general, placed gently over the piano harmony and incredibly light instrumental is a fantastic end to this wild experience… it’s a great ending that feels like a great release from the stylistic journey that exploded in the first half :)</li>
</ul>
