<h1>mini notes for perfect hair</h1>

<ul>
	<li>woah, what a mf intro :O

		<ul>
			<li>that crazed beat and shrill timbre behind these spoken word, confident proclamations are amazing :D</li>
			<li>what a mf intro :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>weird direction to go with bliss point; I&#39;m personally just not super drawn in by those weird, incredibly stuttering rhymes in between that sung chorus?</li>
	<li>okay, well... I think a lot of the bars, and the contributions from aes and danny brown were good in their lyrical ability... but it did absolutely nothing for me rn

		<ul>
			<li>it might be a specific mood I&#39;m in, cause I recognize how good that beat could be, I&#39;m just not rly connecting at all with what&#39;s coming across rn</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>even though it didn&#39;t do a ton for me either, I do really like the esoteric references to introspection on upsweep; that hook is a bit rough, but not a bad track ^</li>
	<li>absolutely love open mike eagle&#39;s contribution, the way he ends his verse is amazing :))

		<ul>
			<li>okay busdriver sounded rly good on that verse too; it took me a little while, but that&#39;s the first above-average track I&#39;ve heard so far ^^</li>
			<li>great stuff :)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>shit okay, while I&#39;m not sure ab the pre-chorus, motion lines is a rly mf good track with that first verse and chorus; this beat is incredible too with how crunchy it is :O

		<ul>
			<li>that second verse was a wild experience :o</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh okay, eat rich is a great little trip; the weird and wild beat and the way it morphs and shifts in itself is a fantastic touch under these bars ^</li>
	<li>king cookie faces (for her) is by far my favorite track, it sounds so vulnerable and open, I love the way the track carries itself :))</li>
	<li>okay honestly, even if I wasn&#39;t sold on it immediately, can you tell i&#39;m a sociopath is a great track to follow right after; that beat is wild, the vocal ad-libs fill things in well, and the wild lyrics and energy sell it for me :)</li>
	<li>colonize the moon is a beautiful closer, and the verse structures are interesting and endearing in the way they&#39;re built

		<ul>
			<li>a confusing, wild experience, but one that ended on a good note :)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
