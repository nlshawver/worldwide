<h1>mini notes for it’s almost dry</h1>

<ul>
	<li>ooh okay right into it :o

		<ul>
			<li>damn that hook on the chorus by push is surprisingly great; his verging-on-singing voice fits this crisp little instrumental :)</li>
			<li>genuinely a fantastic opener, perfect amount of already-there meaning, but in just the right amount that you have time and space to settle in and realize the way the record grows ^^</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>cocaine’s dr. seuss :D

		<ul>
			<li>what an anthemic instrumental under let the smokers shine the coupes; it’s a great continuation, and I’m really like this project so far, even if it’s not the most layered thing I’ve ever heard (but that’s not really the point then is it)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>okay honestly, on first listen, dreamin of the past has probably the most detailed, interesting lyrics from push (to my ears at least); I love the weird sampled production form ye, and his kind of creeping, deeper intonation of his short verse is a good closer :)</li>
	<li>neck &amp; wrist was pretty good too; tbh I didn’t get a ton out of push’s part simply because the previous cuts had more unique passages, but hov’s contribution is a very great addition :))</li>
	<li>woah, was not expecting just so you remember; the way it gives push’s voice the clear space it deserves is a nice kind of minimal production, and the way it wraps around the tracks around it is amazing</li>
	<li>diet coke is so mf good :D

		<ul>
			<li>I honestly don’t have a lot of substance to my thoughts, I’ve just listened to this track so much, and it’s never gotten old- that wild sample throughout the cut and every single flow from push is infectious as all hell</li>
			<li>and above all else, the closing lines (and entirety) of the second verse has some of the most overt social commentary, and I think it comes off beautifully in the mix of this spell of coke rap :))</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>ooh, that beyoncé sample, to kid cudi’s blown-out chorus, into push’s “maybach back, back” line is just incredible :D

		<ul>
			<li>damn okay, I thought pusha’s second verse was just pretty good, but I wasn’t really expecting ye to shine so much on that third verse; I don’t know what it is all together, but the cadence and matching flow with the instrumental gives his words a lot of weight to me :)</li>
			<li>thank u mr cudi c:</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>call my bluff is similar to neck &amp; wrist for me- it’s a pretty good track in the mix of a great record, so it might seem less good than it really is (at least on first listen ofc)</li>
	<li>okay okay, scrape it off might be the low moment tho; there’s nothing inherently wrong with the collaboration, but it just comes together weakly to me (not just in excitement level, but genuine meaning and context of the record)</li>
	<li>ngl though, hear me clearly grew and went way harder than I was expecting :D

		<ul>
			<li>it’s a really short track, but it’s a great moment to keep in the space it has, and it goes right into open air really well (even if open air is very similar in style and length)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>what a fantastic closer though, push comes through with an incredible verse, and mf MALICE :DD

		<ul>
			<li>god damn his verse is absolutely staggering, and such a fantastic moment to close on; great album, and I’m unfortunately regretting the way I handled daytona… but that’ll be revisited soon enough ;)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
